It is possible that I may at\\r\\nsome future time return to these studies to trace the further growth of\\r\\nthe Scandinavian element and its place and influence in American life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour years ago I contributed an article to _The Iowa Journal of\\r\\nHistory and Politics_ upon \"The Scandinavian Factor in the American\\r\\nPopulation,\" in which I discussed briefly the causes of emigration\\r\\nfrom the Northern countries. This article forms the basis of chapters\\r\\nVI-VIII of the present volume, much new evidence from later years\\r\\nhaving, however, been added. In a subsequent issue of the same Journal\\r\\nI published an article on \"The Coming of the Norwegians to Iowa,\" which\\r\\nis embodied in part in chapters III-V of this volume. The remaining\\r\\nthirty-six chapters are new. During the last three summers I have\\r\\ncontinued my investigation of that part of the subject which deals with\\r\\nthe immigration movement. This book represents the results of that\\r\\ninvestigation down to 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor invaluable assistance in the investigation I gratefully acknowledge\\r\\nindebtedness to the numerous pioneers whom, from time to time, I have\\r\\ninterviewed and who so kindly have given the aid sought. I wish to\\r\\nthank, also, several persons who generously have accepted the task of\\r\\npersonally gathering pioneer data for certain localities. For such help\\r\\nI owe a debt of gratitude to the following persons: J. W. Johnson,\\r\\nRacine, Wisconsin; Reverend A. Jacobson, Decorah, Iowa; Reverend G. A.\\r\\nLarsen, Clinton, Wisconsin; Henry Natesta, Clinton, Wisconsin; Rev. O.\\r\\nJ. Kvale, Orfordville, Wisconsin; Rev. J. Nordby, Lee, Illinois; Dr. N.\\r\\nC. Evans, Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin; M. J. Engebretson, Gratiot, Wisconsin;\\r\\nDan K. Anderson and wife, Woodford, Wisconsin; Ole Jacobson, Elk Horn,\\r\\nWisconsin; Samuel Sampson, Rio, Wisconsin; T. M. Newton, Grinnell,\\r\\nIowa; Harvey Arveson, Whitewater, Wisconsin; and Reverend Helge\\r\\nHöverstad, Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin. My thanks are also due to Reverend\\r\\nG. G. Krostu of Koshkonong Parsonage for having placed at my disposal\\r\\nthe Koshkonong Church Register from 1844-1850; as also for verifying\\r\\nmy copy of it in some cases of names and dates; for the privilege\\r\\naccorded me of using these so precious documents I am most grateful.\\r\\nReverend K. A. Kasberg of Spring Grove, Minnesota, has given me certain\\r\\nimportant data on part of the immigration to East Koshkonong in 1842,\\r\\nand similarly N. A. Lie of Deerfield, Wisconsin, for immigration from\\r\\nVoss in 1838-1844, and Mr. Elim Ellingson and wife of Capron, Illinois,\\r\\non the founders of the Long Prairie Settlement. Many others might be\\r\\nmentioned who have given valuable assistance by letter and otherwise\\r\\nin the course of the investigation, and to whom I owe much. Finally,\\r\\nI wish to thank Dr. N. C. Evans of Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin, for the loan\\r\\nof _Cyclopedia of Wisconsin_ (1906) and _Illustreret Kirkehistorie_\\r\\n(Chicago, 1898); Mr. O. N. Falk of Stoughton, Wisconsin, for loaning\\r\\nme _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869-1870, and my brother, Martin O. Flom, of\\r\\nStoughton, for securing for my use several Wisconsin Atlases and a copy\\r\\nof _The Biographical Review of Dane County_ (1893).\\r\\n\\r\\nOf published works on Norwegian immigration which I have found\\r\\nespecially useful are to be mentioned S. Nilsen\\'s _Billed-Magazin_ on\\r\\ncauses of immigration and the earliest immigrants from Telemarken and\\r\\nNumedal; R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter on Norwegian Immigration_\\r\\nfor the sloopers of 1825, and their descendants; Strand\\'s _History\\r\\nof the Norwegians in Illinois_ (1905) for the Norwegians in Chicago;\\r\\nH. L. Skavlem\\'s sketch of _Scandinavians in the Early Days of Rock\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin_, _Normandsforbundet_ for February, 1909, and several\\r\\narticles in _Symra_, 1905-1908. I must also mention a most valuable\\r\\nseries of articles on the Rock Prairie Settlement, Rock County,\\r\\nWisconsin, which appeared in _Amerika_ in 1906. (See further the\\r\\nBibliography at the end of this volume.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one who has never been engaged in a similar undertaking can have any\\r\\nconception of the difficulty of the task and the labor involved in the\\r\\ncollecting, weighing and sifting of the vast amount of detail material.\\r\\nI have tried to write a work which shall be correct as to details and\\r\\nhistorically reliable. That errors have crept in I doubt not. I shall\\r\\nbe grateful to the reader who may discover such errors if he will call\\r\\nmy attention to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I wish to say that I have attempted nothing complete with\\r\\nreference to the personal sketches of the earliest pioneers; this\\r\\nwas manifestly impossible. I have thought also that this was not\\r\\nhere called for except in cases of founders of settlements, and even\\r\\nhere I have sometimes lacked the full facts. To many it will also\\r\\nundoubtedly seem that the early days of the church and the founding of\\r\\ncongregations should have received more attention. I can only say that\\r\\nthis volume deals specifically with the causes, course and progress of\\r\\nNorwegian immigration and that this plan precluded a discussion in this\\r\\nvolume of religious and educational movements among the pioneers, or\\r\\nof social questions, occupations, public service, and like topics. The\\r\\nwork thus aims to keep only what the title promises, and I hope it will\\r\\nbe found to be a real contribution to history within the scope marked\\r\\nout for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  INTRODUCTION                                                        15\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHAPTER I.

Thereupon will follow\\r\\na brief survey of the course of the movement and the growth of the\\r\\nsettlements founded here in that period. In the introductory pages\\r\\nI shall discuss briefly individual immigration from Norway from its\\r\\nearliest known beginnings down to 1825.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration from Norway resulted in the founding of settlements in\\r\\nNew York, Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa successively; I shall try to\\r\\ngive a correct narrative of the beginnings and the growth of these\\r\\nsettlements. In this part of the work I shall stress the oldest and\\r\\nlargest settlements in Southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois, for\\r\\nthe relation of these to the whole movement and later colonization\\r\\nof the Northwestern States by the Norwegians is one of especial\\r\\nimportance. I shall treat somewhat fully of the causes of emigration,\\r\\nof the growth of the movement, and the part in it that each district\\r\\nor province in Norway has played. The leaders from each district\\r\\nand the founders of the settlements here will be named and in many\\r\\ncases, sketches will be given of their lives. Such questions as the\\r\\ncourse of the movement in Norway, the cost of the voyage, the course\\r\\nof the journey, early wage conditions, the economic conditions of\\r\\nthe immigrants, the geographical trend of settlement, will also be\\r\\nconsidered, and approximately complete lists of the accessions in each\\r\\nsettlement for the first few years will be given. The limits of this\\r\\nvolume, however, will preclude the treatment of social or cultural\\r\\nquestions, or to take more than the briefest notice of the pursuits and\\r\\noccupations of the Norwegian-American and his contribution to American\\r\\nlife. I hope to be able to treat elsewhere, later, of some of these\\r\\nproblems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the immigrant settler is one that is well worth the\\r\\ntelling; it is one that is justly receiving increased attention in\\r\\nrecent years. I believe that the writer of American history will, in\\r\\nthe future, pay far greater attention than he has in the past to the\\r\\nimmigrant pioneer as a factor in the development of the nation. There\\r\\nare in America today about one million people of Norwegian birth, or\\r\\nNorwegian parentage. That is, there are nearly half as many of that\\r\\nnationality in America as in Norway itself. The transplanting of so\\r\\nlarge a proportion of a race from the land to which it is rooted by\\r\\nbirth and by its history is indeed remarkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious European peoples have contributed to the growth of the\\r\\nAmerican population; they have each given something to the sum total\\r\\nof present American life and in some measure helped to shape American\\r\\ninstitutions. As a people America is yet in the formative period;\\r\\nracially, at least, one-half of the population is not Anglo-Saxon.\\r\\nIt is by the amalgamation of all its ethnic factors that the future\\r\\nAmerican people will be evolved. The contribution that each foreign\\r\\nelement will make to that evolution will be determined by the\\r\\ncivilization, which each represents as its racial heritage, the culture\\r\\nwhich, in the course of its history, each has evolved as a people\\r\\nand a nation. As the true student of American history takes note of\\r\\nthese things in the future, the significance of the foreign factor in\\r\\nthe growth and the upbuilding of the country will receive its just\\r\\nrecognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe of Norse blood, but American birth, if we are true to the best\\r\\nthat is in us, cannot fail to have an interest in the trials and\\r\\nthe achievements of the pioneer fathers. We must recognize the true\\r\\nheroism of the men and women who braved the hardships and suffered\\r\\nthe privations of frontier life in the thirties, the forties and\\r\\nthe fifties. The part that the pioneers of those days played in the\\r\\ndevelopment of the Northwest was a great one; in comparison with it\\r\\nthat of the present generation is wholly insignificant. It is to the\\r\\nmemory of those pioneers, in recognition of their true worth, that this\\r\\nrecord of their coming is dedicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Norway: Population, Resources, Pursuits of her\\r\\n         People, Social Conditions, Laws and Institutions._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is, as we know, a long and narrow strip of country in the west\\r\\nof the Scandinavian Peninsula, stretching through thirteen degrees of\\r\\nlatitude, and in the north, extending almost three hundred miles into\\r\\nthe arctic zone. Nearly a third of the entire country[1] is the domain\\r\\nof the midnight sun, where summer is the season of daylight and winter\\r\\nis one long unbroken night. Even in Southern Norway total darkness is\\r\\nunknown in summer, the night being merely a period of twilight. In\\r\\nChristiania the nights are light from April twentieth to the third\\r\\nweek in August, in Trondhjem, a week more at either end. In the latter\\r\\ncity there is broad daylight at midnight from May twenty-third to July\\r\\ntwentieth. Correspondingly there is a period of continuous darkness\\r\\nin the extreme north. Thus at Tromsö the sun is not visible between\\r\\nthe twenty-sixth of November and the sixteenth day of January. The\\r\\nlong night is therefore short as compared with the long day of summer.\\r\\nClimatically, also, Norway is naturally a land of extremes, extending,\\r\\nas it does, over such a vast area north and south. Yet the populous\\r\\nportion of the country, the southern two-thirds, is not appreciably\\r\\ncolder than the State of Iowa and the southern half of Wisconsin\\r\\nand Minnesota. The winter is severest in the great inland valleys.\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen, Valders and Hallingdal, but especially in Österdalen.\\r\\nIn the last-named valley the lowest temperature ever observed has been\\r\\nrecorded, namely, 50°, mercury often having been frozen.[2] The winter\\r\\nis also excessively long in these valleys; in Fjeldberg and Jerkin in\\r\\nthe Dovre Mountains the temperature is below the freezing point two\\r\\nhundred days in the year. In the south and in the west coast-districts\\r\\nthe climate is more uniform and more temperate. Northern Norway, with\\r\\nits gulf stream coast, presents the same general climatic conditions\\r\\nas Western and Southern Norway; the inland region of extreme cold is\\r\\nlimited because of the very limited inland area, which also is very\\r\\nsparsely populated.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1] Or over thirty-eight thousand square miles.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [2] Compare Björnson\\'s account of the temperature at Kvikne in his\\r\\n      autobiographical sketch, _Blakken_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [3] The statistical and much of the other matter in this chapter\\r\\n      has been taken from _Norway, Official Publication for the\\r\\n      Paris Exhibition_, 1900, published at Christiania. But I am\\r\\n      also indebted to the stately publication by Norwegian authors\\r\\n      and artists entitled _Norge i det nittende Aarhundrede_, 2\\r\\n      volumes, large folio, 436 and 468 pages.

I wish\\r\\n      to mention also especially here Christensen\\'s _Det nittende\\r\\n      Aarhundredes Kulturkamp i Norge_, Christiania, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of Norway[4] is very unevenly distributed, the north\\r\\nbeing rather thinly settled. The area of Norway is 124,495 square\\r\\nmiles, or somewhat more than that of Wisconsin and Illinois together.\\r\\nAbout four per cent of this, however, is covered by lakes, and the\\r\\naverage number of inhabitants to the square mile is only seventeen. The\\r\\ncorresponding figures of inhabitants to the square mile for Sweden is\\r\\ntwenty-eight; for Denmark, however, it is one hundred and forty-eight,\\r\\nand for all Europe, it is ninety-eight. The density of population is\\r\\ngreatest in Larvik and Jarlsberg on the south (barring the cities of\\r\\nChristiania and Bergen). In these provinces there are one hundred and\\r\\nsixteen inhabitants to the square mile. In Hedemarken the number falls\\r\\nto twelve. The western fjord districts, those of Trondhjem Fjord, the\\r\\nSogne Fjord and the Hardanger Fjord are thickly populated.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [4] It was 1,490,950 in 1855, 2,350,000 in 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is a land of fjords and lakes, of mountains and glacier\\r\\nexpanses. Less than one-fourth of the country is capable of\\r\\ncultivation, and eighty per cent of this is forest land. This leaves\\r\\nless than five per cent under actual cultivation. We may compare again\\r\\nwith Denmark, where seventy-six per cent of the land is cultivated,\\r\\nwhile in all Europe the ratio is forty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway\\'s climate is noted for its healthfulness,[5] and its inhabitants\\r\\nattain a higher degree of longevity than those of most other European\\r\\ncountries. Nearly seven per cent of its people reach the age of sixty\\r\\nto seventy, while one per cent attain to the age of from ninety to one\\r\\nhundred years. That is, reckoned as a whole, about twelve per cent\\r\\nattain to the age of sixty years or more. This is considerable in excess\\r\\nof that of nearly all other European countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [5] Dr. A. Magelson of Christiania has recently written a work on\\r\\n      Norway as a health resort entitled: _To Norway for Health. A\\r\\n      Scientific Account of the Peculiar Advantages of the Norwegian\\r\\n      Climate_, published by Nikolai Olson, Christiania.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average age in Norway is fifty, while for instance, in Italy it\\r\\nis thirty-five. But the expectancy is far more than this for him who\\r\\npasses infancy; thus if one attains to the age of fifty in Norway, one\\r\\nstill may expect to live twenty-three years. Such is the health and the\\r\\nexpectancy of life among our immigrants from Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predominant pursuit in Norway is agriculture, cattle farming and\\r\\nforest cultivation. Herein forty-eight per cent of the population seeks\\r\\nits maintenance. The immigrant pioneer generally selects in America\\r\\nthe pursuit or occupation for which he has been trained in his native\\r\\ncountry. And so we find that the great majority of Norwegian immigrants\\r\\nhave sought homes in rural communities and engaged in farming and\\r\\nrelated pursuits. In fact, more than eighty-eight per cent of our\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants have come from rural communities. Twenty-three\\r\\nper cent of the population of Norway are engaged in industries and\\r\\nmining. To these occupations in this country, Norway has, especially\\r\\nin the later period of immigration, contributed a considerable share.\\r\\nA little over eight per cent of her people are engaged in fishing.\\r\\nAnd so we find that a proportionately very large amount of the New\\r\\nEngland fisheries is conducted by fishermen who have come from Norway.\\r\\nNavigation engages six per cent of the population of Norway. In this\\r\\nconnection I note that our warships in the Spanish-American war were\\r\\nmany of them manned almost exclusively by Norwegian sailors;[6] and\\r\\nthere were Norwegians in the American marine service as early as the\\r\\nWar of Independence, as again in no small proportion in the Civil War\\r\\nin the sixties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [6] _The Reliance_ which defended the America cup against _Shamrock\\r\\n      III_ in 1903 was manned almost exclusively by Norwegians. They\\r\\n      were from the following towns in Norway: Arendal, Aalesund,\\r\\n      Stavanger, Bergen, Larvik, Christiania, and Haugesund.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps about five per cent of Norway\\'s population is engaged in\\r\\nintellectual work. Here, too, the contribution of Norway to our\\r\\npopulation in America has been considerable, especially during the last\\r\\ntwenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all of the Norwegian population is of the Protestant faith, and\\r\\nthe great majority of these are members of the state church, which is\\r\\nthe Lutheran. Somewhat similar are the affiliations in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitution of Norway is liberal and the government highly\\r\\ndemocratic. In these respects the people of Norway are now perhaps as\\r\\nfavorably circumstanced as we in America. The Norwegian readily enters\\r\\ninto the spirit of American laws and institutions, for their laws are\\r\\nnot essentially different from his own. Being accustomed to a high\\r\\ndegree of freedom, he has been trained to a high conception of the\\r\\nresponsibilities that that freedom entails. He has long been accustomed\\r\\nto representation and sharing in the rights of franchise, and he\\r\\nexercises that right as a privilege and a solemn duty. It may be said,\\r\\nI believe, that no people has a higher sense of right and wrong and a\\r\\nstronger moral incentive to right. Frauds in elections and graft in\\r\\nofficial life are yet unheard-of among our Norwegian-American citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is, next to Finland, the most temperate of European countries.\\r\\nThe sale of liquor is permitted only in incorporated cities and\\r\\ntowns, and only by an association that is organized under government\\r\\nsupervision. It is the so-called Gothenburg system that is in use. Of\\r\\nthe earnings of such organization the government takes five per cent,\\r\\nthe county ten per cent and the municipality fifteen per cent, while\\r\\nthe net profit of the association must not exceed five per cent on the\\r\\ninvestment in any one year. The hours of sale are very much restricted.\\r\\nNot only is there no sale of liquor on Sundays, but places of such\\r\\nbusiness must close at one o\\'clock on Saturday and on days preceding\\r\\nholidays. Norway is essentially a temperate country. Statistics show\\r\\nthat out of every thousand deaths, only one is due to drink. The\\r\\nNorwegian people have educated themselves to abstinence, and the\\r\\ntemperance movement found wide support earlier in Norway than anywhere\\r\\nelse. _Det norske Totalafholds Selskab_[7] was organized in 1859; ten\\r\\nyears ago it had ten hundred and twenty branches and a hundred and\\r\\nthirty thousand members, while other temperance associations also have\\r\\na considerable membership. Here in America, the Norwegian immigrant has\\r\\ntaken a prominent part in legislation looking toward the restriction of\\r\\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors,[8] and the Prohibition party finds\\r\\nits strongest support among the Norwegians, as it finds a relatively\\r\\nlarge number of its candidates for state and county offices from among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [7] The Norwegian Total Abstinence Society.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [8] When the Sunday closing order was instituted in Minneapolis\\r\\n      in December, 1905, the _Minneapolis Journal_ commented upon\\r\\n      the fact that the Norwegian citizens made no complaint, as it\\r\\n      appears others did.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime conditions in Norway are similarly significant. Comparative\\r\\nstatistics are difficult of access, but Norway\\'s proportion of\\r\\nserious offences is very low. In the whole period from 1891-1895\\r\\nthe total number was only two hundred and sixty-one. Norway has its\\r\\npoor as every country has, but it has its excellent system of taking\\r\\ncare of the poor. Thus every municipality has a Board of Guardians\\r\\n(fattigkommission), which consists of the parish minister, a police\\r\\nofficer, and several men chosen by a local board. Norway keeps her\\r\\ncriminals and takes care of her poor; she does not send them to\\r\\nAmerica, as has only too often been the case in some other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway has a highly developed school system crowned by the Royal\\r\\nFrederik University at Christiania. It has compulsory education, its\\r\\nboards of inspection and its great Department of Public Instruction. It\\r\\nhas its People\\'s High School, its Workingmen\\'s Colleges, and a system\\r\\nof secondary schools, whose curricula are still on a conservative\\r\\nbasis. Its one University ranks with the foremost in Europe, and with\\r\\nit are connected various laboratories and scientific institutions, and\\r\\nit has a library of three hundred and fifty thousand volumes. Here\\r\\ntoo are located its Botanical Gardens, the Historical Museum, the\\r\\nAstronomical and Magnetic Observatory, the Meteriological Institute\\r\\nand the Biological Marine Station.[9] The salaries of its teachers\\r\\nin _Middelskole Gymnasium_, and of instructors and professors in the\\r\\nUniversity, reckoned by the purchasing power of money, is approximately\\r\\nthirty per cent greater than that of our middle western universities.\\r\\nI shall also mention _The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society_ at\\r\\nTrondhjem, founded 1760, a similar society in Christiania, founded\\r\\n1857, the _Bergen Museum_, founded 1825, with its literary and\\r\\nscientific collections illustrative of the life and cultural history of\\r\\nWestern Norway, _The Norwegian National Museum_ in Christiania, founded\\r\\n1894, similar, but more general in character, _The Industrial Arts\\r\\nMuseum_,[10] and the various archives of the Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [9] This is located at Dröbak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [10] Though Norway\\'s participation in the Universal Exposition at\\r\\n       St. Louis in 1904 as regards number of exhibits was limited,\\r\\n       its exhibits were acknowledged to be of very high grade,\\r\\n       thus in its tapestries, in carved and inlaid work, in silver\\r\\n       and enamel displays it received the highest awards. Report\\r\\n       by Consul Fr. Waage, General Commissioner to the St. Louis\\r\\n       Exposition, _Skandinaven_, June 14th, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the Norwegian language I shall merely speak of its highly\\r\\nanalytic character, in which respect it has for a long time been\\r\\ndeveloping in the same direction as English, though of course,\\r\\nabsolutely independently. Being closely cognate with English, a large\\r\\npart of the vocabulary of the two is of the same stock. Further, its\\r\\nsound system is fundamentally similar. These three considerations,\\r\\nespecially perhaps the first, will make clear to us the reason why\\r\\nthe Norwegian so readily learns to use the English language, and\\r\\nif he learns it in youth, even to the point of mastery. This is of\\r\\nthe greatest importance, for language is in modern times the real\\r\\nbadge of nationality. A correct use of the English language is the\\r\\nfirst and chief stamp of American nationality, the key without which\\r\\nthe foreigner cannot enter into the spirit of American life and\\r\\ninstitutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian literature I cannot either discuss here. The great movements\\r\\nit represents in recent times are fairly well known; its significance\\r\\nand its broad influence are beginning to be understood. The genius of\\r\\nNorwegian literature is morality and truth. It expresses herein the\\r\\nhigh ethical sense of the nation, which is pagan-racial, but which is\\r\\nalso Christian-Lutheran, a church which in its preëminent spirituality\\r\\nis the typical Teutonic church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n                     _Emigration from Norway._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmigration from Norway has in large part been transatlantic. Norway\\r\\nhas lost by American emigration a comparatively larger portion of\\r\\nher population than any other country in Europe, with the exception\\r\\nof Ireland. The great majority of the emigrants have gone to the\\r\\nnorthwestern states and found there their future homes. In Northern\\r\\nIllinois, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, in Northern and Western Iowa,\\r\\nin North and South Dakota, they form a very large proportion of the\\r\\npopulation. Emigration to European countries has been directed chiefly\\r\\nto Sweden and Denmark, though not few have settled in England and\\r\\nGermany and some in Holland. Between 1871 and 1875 about fifteen\\r\\nhundred persons emigrated from Norway to Australia; the number that\\r\\nhave gone there since that has been much smaller. These have settled\\r\\nchiefly in South Australia, Victoria and New Zealand. In recent\\r\\nyears some have settled in the Argentine Republic in South America.\\r\\nNorwegians are found in considerable numbers in Western Canada, but the\\r\\nmajority of these have emigrated from the Norwegian communities in the\\r\\nwestern states, especially Minnesota and North Dakota.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian emigration to the United States took systematic form with\\r\\nthe sailing of Norden and _Den Norske Klippe_ in 1836. In 1843 it began\\r\\nto assume larger proportions; in that year sixteen hundred immigrants\\r\\nfrom Norway settled in the United States. During 1866-1870, a period\\r\\nof financial depression in Norway, there left, on an average, about\\r\\nfifteen thousand a year. The rate fell in the seventies, rose again\\r\\nin the eighties, the figure for 1882 being 29,101 persons, while it\\r\\naveraged over eighteen thousand per annum also for the next decade.\\r\\nIn 1898 it was not quite five thousand, then again it rose steadily,\\r\\nreaching 24,461 in 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegian emigration has been mostly from rural districts,\\r\\nday-laborers, artisans, farmers, seamen, but also those representing\\r\\nother pursuits. Not a few with professional or technical education have\\r\\nsettled in America; we find them in the medical profession,[11] in the\\r\\nministry,[12] in journalism, in the faculties of our colleges. All the\\r\\nage-classes are represented among immigrants from Norway, but by far\\r\\nthe largest number of both men and women have come during the ages of\\r\\ntwenty to thirty-five, and particularly the first half of these series\\r\\nof years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [11] Mostly in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [12] In the early period chiefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great emigration of the Norwegian race during the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury has, of course, very materially retarded the growth of the\\r\\npopulation in Norway, especially in the period from 1865 to 1890. The\\r\\nincrease between 1815 and 1835 was as high as 1.34 per cent annually.\\r\\nFrom 1835 to 1865 it was 1.18 per cent, but during 1865-1890 it fell\\r\\nto 0.65 per cent. Since 1890 the increase has been considerable again.\\r\\nBut during 1866-1903 the total emigration from Norway to the United\\r\\nStates alone aggregated five hundred and twenty-four thousand. To this\\r\\nnumber should be added the children of these if we are to have a proper\\r\\nbasis of estimation for the increase of the race in the last half\\r\\ncentury. This increase thus has been 1.40 per cent annually, that is,\\r\\nthe race has doubled itself in fifty years. We may compare with France,\\r\\nwhere the increase has been 0.23 per cent, Russia,[13] where it has\\r\\nbeen 1.35, in Servia, where it has been 2.00 per cent, this being the\\r\\nhighest in Europe. The increase in Sweden and Denmark is about the same\\r\\nas in Norway--reckoning the racial increase.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [13] The figures here are for the period closing with 1890 before\\r\\n       which year Russia had furnished very few emigrants to the\\r\\n       United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be of interest here to consider briefly the immigration from\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the years 1820-1830 not more than 283 emigrated from the\\r\\nScandinavian countries to the United States. In the following decade\\r\\nthe number only slightly exceeded two thousand. Since 1850 our\\r\\nstatistics regarding the foreign born population are more complete. In\\r\\nthat year we find there were a little over eighteen thousand persons\\r\\nin the country of Scandinavian birth. In 1880 this number had reached\\r\\n440,262; while the unprecedented exodus of 1882 and the following\\r\\nyears had by 1890 brought the number up to 933,249. Thus the immigrant\\r\\npopulation from these countries, which in 1850 was less than one per\\r\\ncent, had in 1890 reached ten per cent of the whole foreign element.\\r\\nThe following table will show the proportion contributed by the\\r\\ncountries designated for each decade since 1850:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                TABLE I\\r\\n\\r\\n                     _1850_ _1860_ _1870_ _1880_ _1890_ _1900_\\r\\n                     -------------PER CENT-------------\\r\\n  Ireland            42.8  38.9  33.3  27.8  20.2  15.6\\r\\n  Germany            26    30.8  30.4  29.4  30.1  25.8\\r\\n  England            12.4  10.5  10     9.9   9.8   8.1\\r\\n  Canada              6.6   6     8.9  10.7  10.6  11.4\\r\\n  Scotland and Wales  4.4   3.7   3.8   3.8   3.7   3.2\\r\\n  Scandinavia          .9   1.7   4.3   6.6  10.1  10.3\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it will be seen that among European countries Scandinavia,\\r\\nconsidered as one, stands third in the number of persons contributed\\r\\nto the American foreign-born population, exceeding that of Scotland\\r\\nand Wales in 1870 and that of England in 1890. Both the Irish and\\r\\nthe German immigration reached considerable numbers at least fifteen\\r\\nyears before that from the North, Ireland having contributed nearly\\r\\nforty-three per cent of the total in 1850, and Germany twenty-six. By\\r\\n1900 the Irish quota had fallen to fifteen per cent, while the German\\r\\nis nearly twenty-six and that from Scandinavia ten per cent. In 1870\\r\\nour Scandinavian-born immigrant population was twice as large as the\\r\\nFrench and equalled the total from Holland, Switzerland, Austria,\\r\\nBohemia, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Russia.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [14] The four last named countries have, as we know, in the last\\r\\n       decade entered very extensively into the emigration movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegians are the pioneers in the emigration movement from the\\r\\nNorth in the nineteenth century; the Danes were the last to come in\\r\\nconsiderable numbers. Statistics, however, show that one hundred\\r\\neighty-nine Danes had emigrated to this country before 1830, while\\r\\nthere were only ninety-four from Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian\\r\\nforeign-born population had in 1850 reached 12,678; while that from\\r\\nSweden was 3,559; and Denmark had furnished a little over eighteen\\r\\nhundred. The Danish immigration was not over five thousand a year until\\r\\n1880 and has never reached twelve thousand. The Swedish immigration\\r\\nreceived a new impulse in 1852; it was five thousand in 1868; it\\r\\nreached its climax of 64,607 in 1882. According to Norwegian statistics\\r\\nthe emigration from Norway to the United States was six thousand and\\r\\nfifty in 1853, but according to our census reports did not reach five\\r\\nthousand before 1866; the highest figure, 29,101, was reached in 1882\\r\\n(according to our census).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [15] Or 28,000 according to Norwegian statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total emigration from the Scandinavian countries to America between\\r\\n1820 and 1903 was 1,617,111. This remarkable figure becomes doubly\\r\\nremarkable when we stop to consider that the population of Denmark,\\r\\nNorway, and Sweden is only two and one-half per cent of the total\\r\\npopulation of Europe; yet they have contributed nearly ten per cent of\\r\\nour immigrant population. There are in this country nearly one-third\\r\\nas many Scandinavians (counting those of foreign birth and foreign\\r\\nparentage both) as in the Scandinavian countries; for the German\\r\\nelement the ratio is one to thirteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point I may refer the reader to the table in Appendix I of\\r\\nthis volume, showing the growth and distribution of the Scandinavian\\r\\nfactor, especially in the northwestern states, since 1850. Table I\\r\\nshows Wisconsin as having almost as large a Scandinavian population\\r\\nin 1850 as all the rest of the country. Wisconsin was the destination\\r\\nof the Norwegian immigrant from the time emigration began to assume\\r\\nlarger proportions, and it held the lead for twenty-five years. Iowa\\r\\nand Southern Minnesota began entering into competition prominently\\r\\nsince 1852 and 1855 respectively. The growth of Swedish immigration in\\r\\nthe fifties and sixties gave the lead to Minnesota by 1870, Illinois\\r\\ntaking second place in 1890. Returning now to the Norwegian immigration\\r\\nspecifically, it may be observed that it was directed to the Northwest\\r\\ndown to recent years, almost to the exclusion of the rest of the\\r\\ncountry. The reader may now be referred to Table II in the Appendix,\\r\\nwhich shows the growth of the Norwegian population in each state since\\r\\n1850.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table tells its own story. In New England the Norwegian factor is\\r\\nunimportant. There has been a high ratio of growth in New York and\\r\\nNew Jersey since 1880, but the total number is not large. In the rest\\r\\nof the Atlantic seaboard states, as in the gulf states, the Norwegian\\r\\npopulation has remained almost stationary at a very low figure. Such is\\r\\nalso the case with the inland states of the South, as in the Southwest.\\r\\nThe effort to direct Norwegian immigration to Texas, which goes back to\\r\\nthe forties, has been productive of only meagre results. Even Kansas\\r\\nis too far south for the Norwegian. In the extreme West, however,\\r\\nconsiderable numbers of Norwegians have established homes since about\\r\\n1882, particularly in California, Oregon and Washington, since 1895\\r\\nalso in Montana, and in recent years even in the extreme North, in\\r\\nAlaska.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat were the influences that directed the Norwegian immigrants so\\r\\nlargely to the Northwest in the early period and down to 1890?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great majority came for the sake of bettering their material\\r\\ncondition. They came here to found a home and to make a living.\\r\\nMoreover, as I have observed above, immigrants in their new home\\r\\ngenerally enter the same pursuits and engage in the same occupations in\\r\\nwhich they were engaged in their native country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree-fourths of the population of Norway live in the rural districts\\r\\nand are mostly engaged in some form of farming.[16] Thus seventy-two\\r\\nper cent of the Norwegian immigrants are found in the rural districts\\r\\nand in towns with less than twenty-five thousand population. The fact\\r\\nthat the influx of the immigrants from Norway coincided with the\\r\\nopening up of the middle western states resulted in the settlement of\\r\\nthose states by Norwegian immigrants. Land could be had for almost\\r\\nnothing in the West. Land-seekers from New England, New York and\\r\\nPennsylvania were in those days flocking to the West.[17] About ninety\\r\\nper cent of the Norwegian immigrants at that time were land-seekers. As\\r\\na rule long before he emigrated the Norseman had made up his mind to\\r\\nsettle in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, or Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [16] This includes also fishermen and foresters.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [17] Outside of Chicago, Illinois had in 1840 a population of\\r\\n       142,210; Wisconsin was organized as a Territory in 1836, its\\r\\n       population in 1840 was 30,945; Iowa had a population of only\\r\\n       192,212 in 1850; and Minnesota, organized at a Territory in\\r\\n       1849, had in 1850, 1,056 inhabitants. To the square mile the\\r\\n       population of each was in 1850: Illinois, 15.37; Wisconsin,\\r\\n       5.66; Iowa, 3.77; Minnesota, .04.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n       _The Earliest Immigrants from Norway, 1620 to 1825._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur data regarding Norwegian emigration to America prior to 1825\\r\\nare very fragmentary, but it is possible to trace that emigration\\r\\nas far back as 1624.[18] In that year a small colony of Norwegians\\r\\nwas established in New Jersey on the site of the present city of\\r\\nBergen.[19] While it is not known that the names of any of these first\\r\\ncolonists have come down to us, we do have the name of one Norwegian,\\r\\nwho visited the American coast on a voyage of exploration in the year\\r\\n1619, that is, the year before the landing of the _Mayflower_. In the\\r\\nearly part of 1619 King Christian IV of Denmark fitted out two ships\\r\\nfor the purpose of finding a northwest passage to Asia. The names of\\r\\nthe ships were _Eenhjörningen_ and _Lampreren_, and the commander was\\r\\na Norwegian, Jens Munk, who was born at Barby, Norway, in 1579. With\\r\\nsixty-six men Jens Munk sailed from Copenhagen, May ninth, 1619. During\\r\\nthe autumn of that year and the early part of the following year he\\r\\nexplored Hudson Bay and took possession of the surrounding country in\\r\\nthe name of King Christian, calling it Nova Dania. The expedition\\r\\nwas, however, a failure, and all but three of the party perished\\r\\nfrom disease and exposure to cold in the winter of 1620. The three\\r\\nsurvivors, among whom was the commander, Jens Munk, returned to Norway\\r\\nin September, 1620.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [18] The Vinland voyages in the 11th-14th centuries do not come\\r\\n       within the scope of our discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [19] It seems that this city was so named by the colonists after\\r\\n       the city of Bergen, Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [20] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_, p. 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the New Netherlands colony, Norwegians sometimes\\r\\ncame across in Dutch ships and settled among the Dutch. The names of\\r\\nat least two such have been preserved in the Dutch colonial records.\\r\\nThey are Hans Hansen and Claes Carstensen (possibly originally Klaus\\r\\nKristenson). The former emigrated in a Dutch ship in 1633 and joined\\r\\nthe Dutch colony in New Amsterdam. His name appears in the colonial\\r\\nrecords variously as Hans Noorman, Hans Hansen de Noorman, Hans Bergen,\\r\\nHans Hansen von Bergen, and Hans Hansen von Bergen in Norwegen. Hans\\r\\nBergen became the ancestor of a large American family by that name.[21]\\r\\nClaes Carstensen\\'s name appears variously as Claes Noorman, Claes\\r\\nCarstensen Noorman and Claes Van Sant, the latter being the Norwegian\\r\\nname Sande in Jarlsberg, where Claes Carstenson was born, 1607. He came\\r\\nto America about 1640 and settled a few years later on fifty-eight\\r\\nacres of land on the site of the present Williamsburg. The ministerial\\r\\nrecords of the old Dutch Reformed Church in New York state that Claes\\r\\nCarstensen was married April 15, 1646, to Helletje Hendricks. The\\r\\nlatter was, it seems, a sister of Annecken Hendricks, who was there\\r\\nmarried on February first, 1650, to Jan Arentzen van der Bilt, the\\r\\ncolonial ancestor of Commodore Vanderbilt. Annecken Hendricks is\\r\\nfurther designated as being from Bergen, Norway, the names \"Helletje\"\\r\\nand \"Annecken\" being Dutch diminutive forms of the Norwegian Helen and\\r\\nAnne. Claes Carstensen died November sixth, 1679.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [21] See _The Bergen Family_, by Teunis Bergen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the year 1700 there were a number of families of Norwegian and\\r\\nDanish descent living in New York. In 1704 a stone church was erected\\r\\nby them on the corner of Broadway and Rector Streets. The property was\\r\\nlater sold to Trinity Church, the present churchyard occupying the site\\r\\nof the original church.[22] Prof. R. B. Anderson, speaking of these\\r\\npeople, says, that they were probably mostly Norwegians and not Danes,\\r\\nfor those of their descendants with whom he has spoken have all claimed\\r\\nNorwegian descent. The pastor who ministered to the spiritual wants of\\r\\nthis first Scandinavian Lutheran congregation in America was a Dane by\\r\\nthe name of Rasmus Jensen Aarhus. He died on the southwest coast of\\r\\nHudson Bay, February twentieth, 1720.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [22] Our authority here is Rev. Rasmus Anderson, who has given this\\r\\n       subject much study.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1740 Norwegian Moravians took part in the founding of a Moravian\\r\\ncolony at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in 1747 of one at Bethabara,\\r\\nNorth Carolina. At Bethlehem these Norwegian (and Swedish and Danish)\\r\\nMoravians came in contact with their kinsmen, the Swedish Lutherans of\\r\\nDelaware and adjoining parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Swedes\\r\\non the Delaware had lost their independence in 1656. New Sweden as a\\r\\npolitical state existed but sixteen years. Ecclesiastically, however,\\r\\nthe Lutherans of New Sweden remained subject to the state church at\\r\\nhome for one hundred and fifty years more, and linguistically the\\r\\ncolony was Swedish nearly as long. In the church records of this colony\\r\\nthere appear not a few Norwegian names, particularly in the later\\r\\nperiod. We know that Norwegians in considerable numbers came to America\\r\\nand joined the Delaware Swedes in the eighteenth century. Gothenburg,\\r\\nwhich lies not far distant from the province of Smaalenene, was at the\\r\\ntime, and has continued to be, the regular Swedish sailing port for\\r\\nAmerica-bound ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most prominent members of the Bethabara Colony was Dr. John\\r\\nM. Calberlane, born 1722 in Trondhjem, Norway. He came to New York in\\r\\n1753, having sailed from London on the ship _Irene_, June thirteenth,\\r\\narriving on September ninth. Dr. Calberlane\\'s name occupies a foremost\\r\\nplace among the old colonial physicians; he was a man of much ability,\\r\\nnoble in character and untiring in his devotion to the welfare of his\\r\\nfellow colonists. On July twenty-eighth, 1759, he himself succumbed to\\r\\na contagious fever that visited the settlement. In a sermon delivered\\r\\non Easter Sunday, 1760, Bishop Spangenberg gave public recognition of\\r\\nCalberlane\\'s service in his short life of six years in the colony.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [23] The name John M. Calberlane, originally Hans Martin Kalberlahn,\\r\\n       is an interesting instance of an early Americanization of a\\r\\n       Norwegian name.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Norwegians among these Moravian colonists were: Susanna\\r\\nStokkeberg, from Söndmöre, Norway, born 1715, who came to America in\\r\\n1744 with her husband, Abraham Reinke, a Swede, to whom she had been\\r\\nmarried that year in Stockholm. Reinke is reputed to have been an able\\r\\npreacher of the gospel, the two laboring together in the congregations\\r\\nof Bethlehem, Nazareth, Philadelphia, and Lancaster. She died in 1758,\\r\\nhe in 1760, leaving a son, Abraham Reinke. Peter Peterson, who was\\r\\nborn in Norway in 1728, and had joined the church in London, came to\\r\\nAmerica as a sailor on the ship _Irene_ in 1749. He died in 1750.\\r\\nJens Wittenberg, a tanner from Christiania, born 1719, came on the\\r\\n_Irene_ in 1754; he died in the colony, 1788. Martha Mans (probably\\r\\nMonsdatter), from Bergen, born 1716, came on the _Irene_ in 1749. She\\r\\nlived in Bethabara as a teacher and religious adviser until 1773.\\r\\nAt the same time, also, came Enert Enerson, a carpenter, while in\\r\\n1759 came Catherine Kalberlahn, and in 1762 Christian Christensen, a\\r\\nshoemaker, from Christiana. The latter was born in 1718; he had lived\\r\\nsome years in Holland before coming to America. The year of his death\\r\\nis 1777. Erik Ingebretsen came over June twenty-second, 1750, via\\r\\nDover, having been on the ocean six weeks, a remarkably short passage\\r\\nfor that time.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [24] For some of these facts I am indebted to Juul Dieserud,\\r\\n       Washington, D. C.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of several Norwegians are recorded who served in the War of\\r\\nthe Revolution. Thus under John Paul Jones served Thomas Johnson, who\\r\\nwas born 1758, the son of a pilot in Mandal, Norway. The _New England\\r\\nHistorical Register_, Volume XXVIII, pages 18-21, gives an account\\r\\nof Johnson\\'s career in the American marine, from which we learn that\\r\\nhe was among those who served on board the _Bon Homme Richard_ in\\r\\nher cruise in 1779, having been transferred by Paul Jones from the\\r\\n_Ranger_. Later he went with Paul Jones to the _Serapis_ and the\\r\\n_Alliance_ and finally to the _Ariel_. With the last ship he arrived\\r\\nin Philadelphia February eighteenth, 1781. For a fuller account of\\r\\nJohnson\\'s career the interested reader is referred to the source of\\r\\nwhich mention has already been made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Johnson lived to the good old age of ninety-three, dying July\\r\\ntwelfth, 1807, in the United States Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.\\r\\nHe had been a pensionist here for a number of years, being known\\r\\ngenerally by the nickname \"Paul Jones.\" A biography of Johnson written\\r\\nby John Henry Sherburne was published at Washington in 1825, to which I\\r\\nhave, however, not had access. Another Norwegian by the name of Lewis\\r\\nBrown (Lars Bruun) also served under John Paul Jones. I lack further\\r\\nparticulars, however, regarding Brown, except that he is spoken of in\\r\\nSherburne\\'s book, _Life of Thomas Johnson_.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Norwegian sailor, Captain Iverson, settled in Georgia some time about\\r\\nthe close of the eighteenth century. United States Senator Iverson from\\r\\nGeorgia was a grandson of this Norwegian sailor pioneer in Georgia.[25]\\r\\nAbout 1805 another sailor, Torgus Torkelson Gromstu, from Gjerpen, near\\r\\nSkien, Norway, settled in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [25] P. S. Vig in his book _De Danske i Amerika_ says Iverson was\\r\\n       of Danish descent but gives no reasons for the claim. As the\\r\\n       name \"Iver\" is peculiarly Norwegian I must therefore adhere to\\r\\n       my view as formerly expressed (_Sc. Immig. to Iowa_).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my article on \"The Danish Contingent in the Population of Early\\r\\nIowa,\" _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, 1906, I spoke of a\\r\\nsociety, styling itself _Scandinavia_, as having been organized in New\\r\\nYork City on June twenty-seventh, 1844. I there designated this as the\\r\\nearliest organization of the kind in this country. This I find now\\r\\nto be incorrect. As early as 1769 the _Societas Scandinaviensis_ was\\r\\nfounded in Philadelphia. The membership of this society was made up of\\r\\nSwedes, Norwegians and Danes, the first of these presumably being in\\r\\nthe majority. The first president of the society was Abraham Markoe\\r\\n(Markö), a Norwegian. One of the memorable events in the history of the\\r\\nsociety was a farewell reception given in \"City Tavern\" on December\\r\\neleventh, 1782, in honor of Baron Axel Ferson, hero of the Battle of\\r\\nYorktown. The committee of seven appointed to present the invitation\\r\\nand also to wait upon General George Washington at Hasbrouch House,\\r\\nNewburg, with a view of securing his presence consisted of the\\r\\nfollowing: Captain Abraham Markoe, Sakarias Paulsen, Andreasen\\r\\nTaasinge, Rev. Andrew Goeranson, Jacob Van der Weer, John Stille and\\r\\nAndrew Keen. Says the chronicler of the event:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"This event was one of the most glorious in the Society\\'s history.\\r\\n  The reception was held at the City Tavern, Wednesday evening,\\r\\n  December eleventh, 1782. The President of the St. Andrew\\'s Society,\\r\\n  Rev. Wm. Smith, D. D., lauded the bravery of the Baron and his men\\r\\n  at the Battle of Yorktown, whereupon General Washington in thanking\\r\\n  the members of the Society for their forethought in tendering\\r\\n  the reception to the noble officer (he subsequently decorated\\r\\n  Ferson with the \"Order of the Cincinnati\" for valor displayed)\\r\\n  expressed his pleasure at being present among the people of his\\r\\n  forefathers\\' blood, as he claimed descent from the family of Wass,\\r\\n  who emigrated from Denmark in the year A. D. 970, and settled in\\r\\n  the County Durham, England, where they built a small town, calling\\r\\n  it Wass-in-ga-tun (town of Wass.)\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [26] Cited from a prospectus of the Society issued in December, 1901,\\r\\n       and kindly sent me by C. M. Machold of Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariant forms of the name Wassingatun are, as given in the prospectus,\\r\\nWessington, Whessingtone, Wasengtone, Wassington and finally\\r\\nWashington. The prospectus itself cites from Machold\\'s _History of the\\r\\nScandinavians in Pennsylvania_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, 1783, General George Washington was elected honorary member\\r\\nof the Society on account of his Norse ancestry. On the twenty-sixth\\r\\nof August, that year, a banquet was given at the City Tavern under\\r\\nthe auspices of the Society, in celebration of the recognition by\\r\\nSweden, Norway, and Denmark of the independence of the United States of\\r\\nAmerica. John Stille was for many years secretary of the Society; after\\r\\nhis death in 1802 all traces of it seem to have vanished. Just when the\\r\\nSocieties Scandinaviensis ceased to exist, the Historian cannot say. On\\r\\nFebruary twentieth, 1868, eighteen gentlemen, all of Scandinavian birth\\r\\nand residents of Philadelphia, met together for the purpose of forming\\r\\na society, and _The Scandinavian Society of Philadelphia_ was founded,\\r\\nan organization which regards itself a continuation of the original\\r\\nsociety. The chief object of the Society is benevolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of at least one Norwegian who fell in the early wars against\\r\\nthe Indians has come down to us. Frank Peterson, who had enlisted on\\r\\nthe fifteenth of June, 1808, was among those who fell at Fort Dearborn\\r\\nin 1812, among the \"first martyrs of the West,\" in an attack by five\\r\\nhundred Pottawattamie Indians. In this battle two-thirds of the whites\\r\\nwere killed and the rest taken prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a later date some other names also appear, but those given are the\\r\\nonly ones of which we have any record. I shall mention here that of Ole\\r\\nHaugen, who probably was the first Norwegian to settle in the State of\\r\\nMassachusetts. Haugen was from Bergen, Norway, and located in Middlesex\\r\\nCounty, that state, in 1815. Alexander Paaske, himself an early\\r\\nimmigrant from Bergen, living in Lowell, Mass., and who was present\\r\\nat Haugen\\'s deathbed, is the source of the above fact. Though going\\r\\nbeyond the scope of our brief survey of this earliest immigration, it\\r\\nmay be of interest here to know that as early as 1817, a girl from\\r\\nVoss, Norway, Anna Vetlahuso, emigrated to America with her husband, a\\r\\nGerman sailor in Bergen, and settled somewhere in South America. The\\r\\nnext recorded names in the order of emigration to the United States\\r\\nare Kleng Peerson and Knud Olson Eide, who in 1821 became the advance\\r\\nguard of a group of fifty-two emigrants that in 1825 founded the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in this country. It is of this sailing and the\\r\\nleaders of this group that I now wish to speak; of Peerson I shall give\\r\\na brief account below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Sloopers of 1825. The First Norwegian Settlement\\r\\n                      in America. Kleng Peerson._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the Sloopers from Stavanger, Norway, who came to America\\r\\nin 1825, has often been told; I shall therefore be very brief in my\\r\\naccount of that expedition. Under causes of emigration I shall have\\r\\noccasion below to note briefly some of the circumstances that seem to\\r\\nhave led to their departure for America in that year. The director\\r\\nof the expedition and the chief owner of the boat was Lars Larson i\\r\\nJeilane; the captain was Lars Olsen. The company consisted of fifty-two\\r\\npersons, all but one being natives of Stavanger and vicinity; the one\\r\\nexception was the mate, Nels Erikson, who came from Bergen. Relative\\r\\nto the leading spirit in this first group of emigrants, Lars Larson, I\\r\\nshall say here: He was born near Stavanger, September twenty-fourth,\\r\\n1787. He became a sailor, was captured in the Napoleonic wars and\\r\\nkept a prisoner in London for seven years. Being released in 1814,\\r\\nhe remained in London, however, till 1815, when he and several other\\r\\nprisoners returned to Norway. In London they had been converted to the\\r\\nQuaker faith by Mrs. Margaret Allen, and upon returning to Stavanger,\\r\\nLars Larson, Elias Tastad, Thomas Helle and Metta Helle became the\\r\\nfounders of the first Quaker society in that city, a society which is\\r\\nstill in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1821 the Stavanger Quakers began to form plans for emigrating to\\r\\nAmerica. It seems that Kleng Peerson and Knud Eide, whom we have\\r\\nmentioned above, were deputed to go to America for the purpose of\\r\\nlearning something of the country with a view to planting there a\\r\\nQuaker colony. Kleng Peerson returned to Stavanger in 1824 with a\\r\\nfavorable report and many of the members of the Quaker colony began to\\r\\nmake preparations for emigrating to the locality selected by Peerson,\\r\\nnamely, Orleans County, New York State. A sloop of only forty-five\\r\\ntons capacity which they called _Restaurationen_, built in Hardanger,\\r\\nwas purchased and loaded with a cargo of iron and made ready for the\\r\\njourney. Larson himself had married in December, 1824, Georgiana\\r\\nPerson, who was born October 19, 1803, on Fogn, a small island near\\r\\nStavanger. Besides him there were five other heads of families. On\\r\\nthe fourth of July, 1825, they set sail from Stavanger. The following\\r\\nfifty-two persons made up the party: Lars Larson and wife Martha\\r\\nGeorgiana; Lars Olson, who was captain of the boat, Cornelius Nelson\\r\\nHersdal, wife and four children;[27] Daniel Stenson Rossadal, wife and\\r\\nfive children;[28] Thomas Madland, wife and three children,[29] Nels\\r\\nNelson Hersdal and wife Bertha, Knud Anderson Slogvig, Jacob Anderson\\r\\nSlogvig, Gudmund Haugaas, Johannes Stene, wife and two children, Öien\\r\\nThorson (Thompson) wife and three children,[30] Simon Lima, wife and\\r\\nthree children, Henrik Christopherson Hervig, and wife, Ole Johnson,\\r\\nGeorge Johnson, Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Nels Thorson, Ole Olson\\r\\nHetletvedt, Sara Larson (sister of Lars Larson), Halvor Iverson, Andrew\\r\\nStangeland, the mate, Nels Erikson, and the cook, Endre Dahl.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [27] Anne (b. 1814), Nels (b. 1816), Inger (b. 1819), and Martha\\r\\n       (b. 1823).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [28] Ellen (b. 1807), Ove (b. 1809), Lars (b. 1812), John (b.\\r\\n       1821), Hulda (b. 1825).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [29] Rachel (b. 1807), Julia (b. 1810), Senena (b. 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [30] Sara (b. 1818), Anna Maria (b. 1819), Caroline (b. 1825).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a perilous voyage of fourteen weeks they landed in New York,\\r\\nOctober ninth. An account of that voyage, which also it seems was a\\r\\nrather adventurous one, was given by the New York papers at the time;\\r\\nit was reproduced in Norwegian translation in _Billed-Magazin_ in\\r\\n1869, whence it has been copied in other works. The arrival of this\\r\\nfirst party of Norwegian immigrants, and in so small a boat, created\\r\\nnothing less than a sensation at the time, as we may infer from the\\r\\nwide attention the event received in the eastern press. Thus the _New\\r\\nYork Daily Advertiser_ for October twelfth, 1825, under the head lines,\\r\\n\"A Novel Sight,\" gives an account of the boat, the destination of the\\r\\nimmigrants, the country they came from, their appearance, etc. For\\r\\nthis citation I may refer the reader to page 39 of my article on \"The\\r\\nComing of the Norwegians to Iowa\" in _The Iowa Journal of History and\\r\\nPolitics_, 1905, or to R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter of Norwegian\\r\\nImmigration_, 1896, 70-71.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New York the immigrants met Mr. Joseph Fellows, a Quaker, from whom\\r\\nthey purchased land in Orleans County, New York. It seems to have been\\r\\nupon the suggestion of Mr. Fellows that they were induced to settle\\r\\nhere, although it is possible that the land had already been selected\\r\\nfor them by Kleng Peerson, who was in New York at the time. The price\\r\\nto be paid for the land was five dollars an acre, each head of a family\\r\\nand adult person purchasing forty acres. The immigrants not being able\\r\\nto pay for the land, Mr. Fellows agreed to let them redeem it in ten\\r\\nannual installments. For the further history of the colony, with which\\r\\nwe are here not so much concerned, the reader is referred to Knud\\r\\nLangeland\\'s _Nordmaendene i Amerika_, Chicago, 1889, pp. 10-19, or to\\r\\nAnderson\\'s _First Chapter_, pp. 77-90.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already mentioned Kleng Peerson, a name familiar to every\\r\\nstudent of Norwegian pioneer history. Much has been written about\\r\\nthis pathfinder in the West, and romance and legend already adorn his\\r\\nmemory. It would be interesting to recount what we know of his life in\\r\\nAmerica, but as this has been dealt with at length by Professor R. B.\\r\\nAnderson in his monograph on Norwegian Immigration, which is in large\\r\\npart devoted to the slooper\\'s history, I may refer the interested\\r\\nreader to this work. _Symra_ (Decorah, Iowa) for 1906 also contains a\\r\\nbrief, somewhat eulogistic account in Norwegian of Peerson\\'s stay in\\r\\nNew York and his journey of exploration to Illinois, Missouri, and\\r\\nTexas. The briefest facts I may, however, relate here.\\r\\n\\r\\nKleng Peerson was born on the seventeenth of May, 1782, on the estate\\r\\nHesthammer in Tysvær Parish, Province of Ryfylke. In 1820 we find\\r\\nhim in Stavanger, where William Allen, an English Quaker, was then\\r\\norganizing a Quaker society. In 1821 Kleng Peerson and a certain Knud\\r\\nOlson Eide were, as we have seen, commissioned, it appears, by the\\r\\nQuakers to go to America and examine the possibility of organizing a\\r\\nNorwegian colony there. The two explorers secured work in New York\\r\\nCity, but Knud Eide fell ill and died not long after, and Peerson went\\r\\nwest alone in quest of a suitable location for a colony. Just how far\\r\\nwest he may have come on this first journey is not known. After some\\r\\ntime he decided upon Orleans County on the shores of the Ontario as the\\r\\nbest place to plant his colony, and in 1824 he returned to Norway. We\\r\\nhave noted already the results of Peerson\\'s mission. When Lars Larson\\'s\\r\\nparty prepared to go to America Kleng Peerson also left, but he did\\r\\nnot take passage in _Restaurationen_. It seems that he embarked by way\\r\\nof Gothenburg and was in New York to receive the sloopers upon their\\r\\narrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be natural to suppose that Peerson did not go alone from\\r\\nStavanger when he returned to America via Gothenburg in 1825. After\\r\\nmuch inquiry I have also succeeded in discovering the name of one man,\\r\\nwho, with his family, accompanied Peerson that year. This man was\\r\\nBjörn Björnson from Stavanger, a cousin of Kleng Peerson; he brought\\r\\nhis wife and several children with him, but left two girl twins, born\\r\\nin May of that year, with a relative who then lived in Tjensvold, near\\r\\nStavanger. Further facts about this family will be given in the chapter\\r\\non Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Peerson seems to play no role in the founding of the Orleans County\\r\\nsettlement, I shall leave him here. There will be occasion to speak\\r\\nbriefly of him again later in connection with the second Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement. I wish to add a few words here about Lars Larson, however.\\r\\nHe and his family located in Rochester, where he became a builder\\r\\nof canal boats, prospered; and kept in close touch with immigrant\\r\\nNorwegians during the two decades of his life there. His home became a\\r\\nkind of Mecca for hosts of intending settlers in the New World. Larson\\r\\ndied by accident on a canal boat in November, 1845, but his widow lived\\r\\ntill October, 1887. They had eight children, of whom the first one,\\r\\nMargaret Allen, was born on the Atlantic Ocean, September second, 1825.\\r\\nOf her and others of Lars Larson\\'s descendants I shall speak briefly\\r\\nbelow. We shall now return to the settlers in Orleans County, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony was in many respects unfortunate; it cannot be said to\\r\\nhave prospered and has never played any important part as a colony in\\r\\nNorwegian-American history. But it is important as being the first,\\r\\nand also as being the parent of a very large and progressive Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement founded in 1834-35 in La Salle County, Illinois, of which\\r\\nmore below. And yet the economic conditions of the Quaker immigrants\\r\\ngradually became better and the future looked more promising. They felt\\r\\nnow that America offered many advantages to the able and the capable,\\r\\nand they began writing encouraging letters to relatives and friends in\\r\\nthe old country, urging them to seek their fortune here. As a result\\r\\nthere was, if not a large, at any rate a fairly constant emigration\\r\\nof individuals and families from Stavanger and adjacent region during\\r\\nthe following eight or nine years, although few seem to have come\\r\\nbefore 1829. In this year, e. g., came Gudmund Sandsberg (b. 1787) from\\r\\nHjelmeland, in Ryfylke, Norway, and his wife Marie and three children,\\r\\nBertha, Anna, and Torbjör.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassage was secured in the beginning for the most part with American\\r\\nsailships carrying Swedish iron from Gothenburg. But as this was\\r\\nattended by much uncertainty, often necessitating several weeks of\\r\\nwaiting, the intending emigrants began to go to Hamburg, where German\\r\\nemigration by means of regular going American packet ships had already\\r\\nbegun. Here, however, another difficulty met them. The already somewhat\\r\\nheavy emigration at this port made it necessary to order passage\\r\\nseveral weeks ahead in order to insure accommodations, and failing in\\r\\nthis, the emigrant was forced to wait there until the next packet boat\\r\\nshould sail. And so it came about that many of the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants to America came by way of Havre, France, where passage was\\r\\nalways certain, emigration from this point being as yet very limited.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came via Gothenburg was Gjert Hovland, a farmer from\\r\\nHardanger, who left Norway with his family on the twenty-fourth of\\r\\nJune, 1831, sailed from Gothenburg June thirtieth and arrived in New\\r\\nYork September eighteenth. He does not seem to have gone directly to\\r\\nKendall, for we find him soon after the owner of fifty acres of forest\\r\\nland in Morris County, New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nGjert Hovland seems to be the first one from the province of Hardanger\\r\\nto emigrate to America. Other emigrants during these years are:\\r\\nChristian Olson, who came in 1829, settling in Kendall; Knut Evenson,\\r\\nwife and daughter Katherine, who emigrated in 1831 in the same ship\\r\\nby which Hovland came; and Ingebret Larson Narvig from Tysvær Parish,\\r\\nRyfylke, who came in 1831 and two years later located in Michigan.\\r\\nIt seems probable that also Johan Nordboe and wife from Ringebo, in\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen, Norway, came to Orleans County in 1832. Nordboe was the\\r\\nfirst to emigrate from Gudbrandsdalen, a province from which actual\\r\\nimmigration did not begin until sixteen years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants who came during these years generally located\\r\\nin Orleans County, but rarely remained there permanently. The\\r\\nnorthwestern states were just then beginning to be opened up to\\r\\nsettlers. At this time migration from the eastern states was directed\\r\\nparticularly to Illinois. Good government land could be had here\\r\\nfor $1.25 an acre. The very heavily wooded land that the Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants in Orleans County had purchased proved very difficult of\\r\\nimprovement, and many began to think of moving to a more favorable\\r\\nlocality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1833 Kleng Peerson, who seems to have lived in Kendall at this\\r\\ntime, made a journey to the West, evidently for the purpose of finding\\r\\na suitable site for a new settlement. He was accompanied by Ingebret\\r\\nLarson Narvig as far as Erie, Monroe County, Michigan, where the latter\\r\\nremained, Peerson continuing the journey farther west. After several\\r\\nmonths of wandering across Michigan, and down into Ohio and Indiana, he\\r\\nat last arrived at Chicago, then a village of about twenty huts. The\\r\\nmarshes of Chicago did not appeal to Peerson and he went to Milwaukee,\\r\\nbut the reports he received of the endless forests of Wisconsin soon\\r\\ndrove him back again into Illinois. After several days\\' journey on foot\\r\\nagain west of Chicago he at last found a spot which seemed to him as\\r\\nif providentially designated as the proper locality for his western\\r\\ncolony. The place was immediately south of the present village of\\r\\nNorway in La Salle County. His choice made, Peerson returned to Orleans\\r\\nCounty, having covered over 2,000 miles on foot since he left.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeerson\\'s selection was universally approved and a considerable\\r\\nnumber of the Kendall settlers decided to move west. Among those of\\r\\nthe sloopers who remained in New York I shall here name: Ole Johnson,\\r\\nHenrik C. Hervig and Andrew Stangeland, who, however, some years later\\r\\nbought a tract of land in Noble County, Indiana; Lars Olson located in\\r\\nNew York City, and, as we have seen, Lars Larson settled in Rochester;\\r\\nNels Erikson went back to Norway, while Öien Thompson and Thomas\\r\\nMadland died in Kendall in 1826, and Cornelius Hersdal died there in\\r\\n1833.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n               _The Founding of the Fox River Settlement.\\r\\n                Personal Notes on Some of the Founders._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1834 Jacob Anderson Slogvig, Knud Anderson Slogvig,\\r\\nGudmund Haugaas, Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Nels Thompson,[31] Andrew\\r\\n(Endre) Dahl, and Kleng Peerson left for La Salle County; they became,\\r\\ntherefore, as far as we know, the first Norwegian settlers in Illinois,\\r\\nand indeed in the Northwest, barring Ingebret Narvig, who had located\\r\\nin Michigan the year before. These men selected their land and\\r\\nperfected their purchase as soon as it came into market the following\\r\\nspring. The first two to buy land were Jacob Slogvig and Gudmund\\r\\nHaugaas, whose purchase is recorded under June fifteenth, 1835, the\\r\\nformer of eighty acres, the latter one hundred and sixty acres, both\\r\\nin that part of what was then called Mission Township, but later came\\r\\nto be Rutland. On June seventeenth, Kleng Peerson\\'s purchase of eighty\\r\\nacres is recorded, as also that of his sister, Carrie Nelson, widow of\\r\\nCornelius Nelson Hersdal, namely, eighty acres of land bought for her\\r\\nby Peerson. For this date are also recorded the purchases of Thorsten\\r\\nOlson Bjaaland, eighty acres, Nels Thompson, one hundred and sixty\\r\\nacres, in what later became Miller Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [31] Nels Thompson had married Bertha Caroline, the widow of\\r\\n       Olen Thompson in 1827. She had three daughters by her first\\r\\n       husband: Sara, born 1818; Anna, born 1819; and Caroline, born\\r\\n       1825 (died in Rochester, N. Y., 1826). Nels Thompson and wife\\r\\n       had two children: Serena, born 1828; Abraham, born 1830; and\\r\\n       Caroline, born in 1833.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1835 Daniel Rossadal and family, Nels Nelson Hersdal, George\\r\\nJohnson, and Carrie Nelson Hersdal with family of seven children moved\\r\\nto La Salle County. Nels Hersdal secured six hundred and forty acres in\\r\\nexchange for one hundred acres he owned in Orleans County, New York.\\r\\nThe slooper Thomas Madland, as we have seen, died in 1826; his widow\\r\\nand family of seven also moved to Illinois in 1831. Gjert Hovland came\\r\\nin 1835, and on June seventeenth purchased one hundred and sixty acres\\r\\nof land in Miller Township. Nels Hersdal purchased on September fifth\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland\\'s eighty acres in the same township; the latter,\\r\\nhowever, bought a hundred and sixty acres again on January sixteenth,\\r\\n1836, in the same locality. The record of these purchases was copied by\\r\\nR. B. Anderson and printed in his book, _First Chapter_, etc., cited\\r\\nabove and also in Strand\\'s _History of the Norwegians of Illinois_,\\r\\npage 75.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnud Slogvig, who, as we see, came in 1834, did not buy land but\\r\\nsomewhat later returned east and in 1835 went back to Norway. There\\r\\nhe married a sister of the slooper, Ole Olson Hetletvedt and, as\\r\\nwe shall have occasion to note under causes of emigration, became\\r\\nlargely instrumental in bringing about the emigration of 1836.\\r\\nBaldwin\\'s _History of La Salle County_ also states, page 74, that\\r\\nOliver Canuteson,[32] Oliver Knutson,[32] Christian Olson, and Ole\\r\\nOlson Hetletvedt came to the county in 1834, but the date seems to be\\r\\nuncertain. With regard to Christian Olson the fact seems rather to be\\r\\nthat he came in 1836 or possibly not till 1837, while also Hetletvedt\\r\\nseems to be dated about two years too early here. Among those who\\r\\ncame in 1836 according to apparently reliable records are: Ole Olson\\r\\nHetletvedt and Gudmund Sandsberg.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [32] Or are these two the same person?\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative to the founders of the Fox River Settlement, as that of La\\r\\nSalle County came to be called, I wish to add here the following\\r\\nfacts of personal history: Gudmund Haugaas, one of the two first to\\r\\nrecord the purchase of land, had married Julia, the daughter of Thomas\\r\\nMadland, in Orleans County in 1827. She died in Rutland Township, La\\r\\nSalle County, in 1846 and he later married Caroline Hervig, a sister\\r\\nof Henrik Hervig (Harwick). He had ten children by his first wife.\\r\\nIn Illinois he joined the Mormon Church and became an elder in that\\r\\nchurch, practicing medicine at the same time, and, it is said, with\\r\\nmuch success. He died of the cholera on the homestead near Norway in\\r\\nJuly, 1849; his widow, Caroline, survived him three years.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [33] Mrs. R. W. Bower of Sheridan, Illinois, is a daughter of\\r\\n       Haugaas and his wife Caroline. Other children of his are\\r\\n       Daniel Haugaas in Henderson, Iowa, and Mrs. Isabel Lewis,\\r\\n       Emington, Illinois, and Thomas Haugaas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJacob Slogvig married Serena, daughter of Thomas Madland, in March,\\r\\n1831. He became one of the founders of the Norwegian settlement in Lee\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, in 1840 (see below), later went to California, where\\r\\nhe died in May, 1864. The widow lived until about 1897. Some time\\r\\nbefore her death she had been living at the home of her son, Andrew J.\\r\\nAnderson, at San Diego, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Carrie Nelson had seven children, of whom Anne, Nels, Inger, and\\r\\nMartha were born in Norway; Sarah, Peter, and Amelia were born at\\r\\nKendall, New York. Carrie Nelson died in 1848. The son, Nels Nelson,\\r\\nborn 1816, married Catherine Iverson about 1840; he died in Sheridan,\\r\\nIllinois, in August, 1893, as the last male member of the sloop party,\\r\\nbeing survived by his widow and four of twelve children. The daughter\\r\\nInger was in 1836 married to John S. Mitchell, of Ottawa, Illinois;\\r\\nMartha married Beach Fallows, a settler of 1835, and Sarah married in\\r\\n1849 Canute Marsett, an immigrant of 1837, who some years later became\\r\\na Mormon bishop at Ephraim, Utah. Their oldest son, Peter Cornelius\\r\\nMarsett, born at Salt Lake City June second, 1850, was the first child\\r\\nborn of Norwegian parents in Utah.[34] Peter C. Nelson, the youngest\\r\\nson of Carrie Nelson, born 1830, later settled in Larned, Kansas, where\\r\\nhe died in 1904. Sara Thompson, oldest daughter of Öien Thompson,\\r\\nand born 1818, married George Olmstead in 1857 in La Salle County;\\r\\nhe died in 1849, and in 1855 she married William W. Richey. Mrs.\\r\\nRichey settled in Guthrie Center, Iowa, in 1882, where she lived until\\r\\nrecently. Benson C. Olmsted, Charles B. Olmsted and Will F. Richey of\\r\\nGuthrie Center, Iowa, are sons of Mrs. Sara Richey. Nels Thompson died\\r\\nin La Salle County, Illinois, in July, 1863. Daniel Rossadal and his\\r\\nwife, Bertha, both died in La Salle County in 1854. Nels Nelson Hersdal\\r\\nwas born in July, 1800, and his wife, Bertha, in May, 1804; they were\\r\\nmarried a few months before the departure of the sloop. He, \"Big Nels\",\\r\\nas he was called, came to Illinois in 1835, returned to New York and\\r\\ndid not bring his family to Illinois until 1846, though he moved west\\r\\nbefore. He lived until 1886, his wife having died in 1882. Peter Nelson\\r\\nand Ira Nelson of La Salle County, are their sons. George Johnson died\\r\\nfrom cholera in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [34] For these facts I am indebted to R. B. Anderson, as also\\r\\n       for other details of the personal history of the slooper\\'s\\r\\n       descendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Dahl went to Utah in the fifties, being one of the earliest\\r\\npioneers of that state. A son of his, A. S. Anderson, was a member\\r\\nof the Utah Constitutional Convention in 1895. Ole Hetletvedt, who\\r\\nlocated at Niagara Falls, not therefore in Orleans County, had three\\r\\nsons, Porter C., Sören L. and James W. The first of these, born 1831,\\r\\nbecame captain and later colonel in Company F, 36th Regiment, Illinois\\r\\nVolunteers, in the War of the Rebellion, and was Acting Brigadier\\r\\nGeneral when he was killed in the Battle of Franklin (Tenn.). Sören\\r\\nOlson was killed in the Battle of Murfreesboro. James Olson, who also\\r\\nwent to the front, lived to return to his home after the war. Porter\\r\\nOlson lies buried at Newark, Illinois, where a fitting monument adorns\\r\\nhis grave. Finally I wish to add that Margaret Allen, the \"sloop girl\"\\r\\nborn on the Atlantic, daughter of Lars Larson, married John Atwater in\\r\\nRochester, New York, in 1857. They afterwards moved to Chicago, where\\r\\nhe died in the early nineties, while Mrs. Atwater is, I believe, still\\r\\nliving at Western Springs, Cook County. We shall now return to our\\r\\nsettlement in La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have given above a brief account of the founding of the Fox River\\r\\nsettlement. Out of that nucleus of about thirty persons, whom we\\r\\nknow to have come there in 1834-35 grew up one of the largest and\\r\\nmost prosperous of rural communities in the country. The settlement\\r\\ndeveloped rapidly, before many years extending into Kendall, Grundy and\\r\\nDeKalb counties and becoming a distributing point in the westward march\\r\\nof Norwegian immigration during the following years. The settlement\\r\\nin Orleans County, New York, ceased to grow, the objective point of\\r\\nimmigrants from Norway had been changed and the Fox River region\\r\\nreceived large accessions, especially during the year 1836.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration from Norway which heretofore had been more or less\\r\\nsporadic, in which individuals and very small groups are found to take\\r\\npart, now enters upon a new phase, begins in fact to assume the form of\\r\\norganized effort. The year 1836 inaugurated this change, while in 1837\\r\\nthere was something approaching an exodus from certain localities in\\r\\nWestern Norway. The desire to emigrate to America had also now spread\\r\\nfar beyond the original center, at Stavanger; the source of emigration\\r\\nwas transferred to a more northerly region and with it, as we have had\\r\\noccasion to observe above, the course of settlement in this country is\\r\\nnot only directed to a more westerly region, Illinois, but also soon\\r\\nextends into the northern border counties of Illinois and into southern\\r\\nand southeastern Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this increased immigration is historically associated with the names\\r\\nof two of those whom we have already met as pioneers in New York, New\\r\\nJersey and Illinois, a brief account of their share in the promotion\\r\\nof immigration from Norway will be in place. These two are Gjert\\r\\nHovland and Knud Slogvig. We have seen that the former of these came\\r\\nto America in 1831, being probably the first immigrant from Hardanger.\\r\\nHis name deserves special mention as an early promoter of emigration\\r\\nfrom southwestern Norway, especially from his own province. He was\\r\\na man of much enlightenment and liberalmindedness to whom America\\'s\\r\\nfree institutions made a strong appeal. He wrote letters home to\\r\\nfriends urging emigration and these were circulated far and wide. In\\r\\none of these letters from Morris County, New Jersey, 1835, he writes\\r\\nenthusiastically of American laws, and he contrasts its spirit of\\r\\nliberty with the oppressions of the class aristocracy in Norway. He\\r\\nadvised all who could do so to come to America, where it was permitted\\r\\nto settle wherever one chose, he says. Hovland was well known in\\r\\nseveral parishes in the Province of South Bergenhus, and hundreds of\\r\\ncopies of his letters were circulated there; they aroused the greatest\\r\\ninterest among the people and were no small factor in leading many in\\r\\nthat region to emigrate in 1836-37.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it may be noted specifically that in 1836 a lay preacher\\r\\ntravelling in Voss had in his possession one of Gjert Hovland\\'s\\r\\nletters, which letter was read by Nils Röthe, Nils Bolstad and John H.\\r\\nBjörgo and others. These three since said that it was the reading of\\r\\nHovland\\'s letter which induced them to immigrate.[35] Gjert Hovland,\\r\\nas we have seen, came to Illinois in 1835. His purchase of one hundred\\r\\nand sixty acres of land in the present Miller Township was recorded\\r\\non June seventeenth of that year, the same date that the purchases of\\r\\nKleng Peerson, Nels Thompson and Thorsten Bjaaland were recorded. Gjert\\r\\nHovland lived there till his death in 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [35] _First Chapter_, p. 331.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other name, that I referred to, is that of Knud Anderson Slogvig,\\r\\nwho undoubtedly was the chief promoter of immigration in 1836. He had\\r\\ncome in the sloop in 1825, and, as we have seen, settled in La Salle\\r\\nCounty in 1834. In 1835 he returned to Skjold, Norway, and there\\r\\nmarried a sister of Ole O. Hetletvedt, the slooper whom we find as one\\r\\nof the early pioneers of La Salle County. While there, people came to\\r\\ntalk with him about America from all parts of southwestern Norway; and\\r\\na large number in and about Stavanger decided to emigrate. Slogvig\\'s\\r\\nreturn may be said to have started the \"America-fever\" in Norway,\\r\\nthough it took some years before it reached the central and the eastern\\r\\nparts of the country. It was his intention to return to America in\\r\\n1836, and a large party was preparing to emigrate with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of that year the two brigs, _Norden_ and _Den Norske\\r\\nKlippe_, were fitted out from Stavanger. The former sailed on the first\\r\\nWednesday after Pentecost, arriving in New York July twelfth, 1836. The\\r\\nlatter sailed a few weeks later. They carried altogether two hundred\\r\\nimmigrants, most of whom went directly to La Salle County. Of these two\\r\\nbrigs I shall speak again in a subsequent chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have above given some of the facts of Knud Slogvig\\'s personal\\r\\nhistory. Having already spoken of one element in the cause of\\r\\nemigration I believe it will be in place to give a fuller account at\\r\\nthis point of the various general and special factors that have been\\r\\ninstrumental in bringing about the coming to America of such a large\\r\\npart of the population of Norway in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n                   _Causes of Emigration from Norway.\\r\\n                      General Factors, Economic._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes that have brought about the exodus from Norway\\r\\nand in general from the Scandinavian countries in the 19th century?\\r\\nThe question is not a simple one to answer; for the causes have been\\r\\nmany and varied, and it would be impossible in the following pages to\\r\\ndiscuss all the circumstances and influences that have operated to\\r\\npromote the northern emigration and directed it to America. Perhaps\\r\\nthere is something in the highly developed migratory instinct of\\r\\nIndo-European peoples. Especially has this instinct characterized the\\r\\nGermanic branch, whether it be Goth or Vandal, Anglo-Saxon, Viking or\\r\\nNorman,[36] or their descendants, the Teutonic peoples of modern times,\\r\\nby whom chiefly the United States has been peopled and developed.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [36] That is, \"Northman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf tangible motives, one that has everywhere been a fundamental\\r\\nfactor in promoting emigration from European countries in modern\\r\\ntimes has been the prospect of material betterment. Where no barriers\\r\\nhave been put against the emigration of the poor or the ambitious,\\r\\nunless special causes have arisen to create discontent with one\\'s\\r\\ncondition, the extent to which European countries have contributed\\r\\nto our immigrant population may be measured fairly closely by the\\r\\neconomic conditions at home. As far as the Northern countries are\\r\\nconcerned I would class all these causes under two heads: the first\\r\\nwill comprise all those conditions, natural and artificial, that can be\\r\\nsummarized under the term economic; the second will include a number of\\r\\nspecial circumstances or motives which may vary somewhat for the three\\r\\ncountries, indeed often for the locality and the individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst then we may consider the causes which arise from economic\\r\\nconditions. These are well illustrated by the Scandinavian countries,\\r\\nslightly modified in each case by the operation of the special causes.\\r\\nNorway is a land of mountains, these making up in the fact fifty-nine\\r\\nper cent of its total area, while forty-four per cent of the soil of\\r\\nSweden is unproductive. The winters are long and severe, the cold\\r\\nweather frequently sets in too early for the crops to ripen; with crop\\r\\nfailure comes lack of work for the laboring classes, and, burdened\\r\\nby heavy taxation, as was the Norwegian farmer only too often in the\\r\\nmiddle of the last century, debt and impoverishment for the holders\\r\\nof the numerous encumbered smaller estates. In Norway, especially,\\r\\nthe rewards of labor are meagre and the opportunities for material\\r\\nbetterment small.[37] \"Hard times\" and the inability of the country\\r\\nto support the rapidly increasing population has, then, been a most\\r\\npotent factor.[38] The same will hold true of Sweden, though in a\\r\\nsomewhat less degree. Denmark is better able to support a population\\r\\nof one hundred and forty-eight to the square mile than Sweden one of\\r\\ntwenty-eight or Norway one of eighteen.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [37] A great change for the better has been taking place during the\\r\\n       last few years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [38] Thus the failure of crops and the famine in Northern Sweden,\\r\\n       Finland, and Norway in 1902 was followed by a vastly increased\\r\\n       immigration from these sections. See above page 28. Compare\\r\\n       Table II, Appendix.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [39] The area and population of the three countries are:--Sweden,\\r\\n       area 172,876 sq. m., population in 1901, 5,175,228; Norway,\\r\\n       area 124,129, population in 1900, 2,239,880; Denmark, area\\r\\n       15,360, population in 1901, 2,447,441.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection compare above the statistics of immigration from\\r\\nthe three countries, which are much lower for Denmark than for Norway\\r\\nand Sweden. The Danes at home are a contented people, and it is\\r\\nnoticeable also that it is they who are most conservative here, who\\r\\nfoster the closest relation with the old home, and who consequently\\r\\nbecome Americanized last. The Norwegians are the most discontented, are\\r\\nreadiest for a change, are quickest to try the new; and it is they who\\r\\nmost readily break the bonds that bind them to their native country,\\r\\nwho most quickly adapt themselves to the conditions here, and who most\\r\\nrapidly become Americanized.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor R. B. Anderson, in his book on the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration[40] puts religious persecution as the primary cause of\\r\\nemigration from Norway. I cannot possibly believe that even in the\\r\\nimmigration of the first half of the nineteenth century religious\\r\\npersecution was, except in a few cases, the primary or even a very\\r\\nimportant cause in the Scandinavian countries. In conversation with and\\r\\nin numerous letters from pioneers and their descendants, especially\\r\\nin Iowa and Wisconsin, I have found that the hope of larger returns\\r\\nfor one\\'s labor is everywhere given as the main motive, sometimes as\\r\\nthe only one. Whether it be the pioneers of La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nin the thirties, those of Rock or Dane counties, Wisconsin, in the\\r\\nforties, or the Norwegian settlers of Clayton and Winneshiek counties,\\r\\nIowa, in the late forties and the fifties; the causes are everywhere\\r\\nprincipally economic. But letters written by pioneers and by those\\r\\nabout to emigrate testify amply to the fact that it was the hard times\\r\\nthat was the chief cause. And the same applies almost as generally to\\r\\nthe Swedes; among the Danes the economic factor has not operated so\\r\\nextensively, though here, also, it was the preponderating cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [40] _First Chapter, etc._\\r\\n\\r\\nA Norwegian journal, _Billed-Magazin_, published in Chicago in 1869-70\\r\\nand edited by Professor Svein Nilsen, offers much that throws light\\r\\non this question. It contains brief accounts of the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration and the earliest settlements, a regular column of news\\r\\nfrom the Scandinavian countries, interviews with pioneers, etc. In one\\r\\ninterview, Ole Nattestad, who sailed in 1837 from Vægli, Numedal, and\\r\\nbecame the founder of the fourth Norwegian settlement in America, that\\r\\nof Jefferson Prairie in Rock County, Wisconsin, and the neighboring\\r\\nBoone County in Illinois, describes his experience as a farmer in\\r\\nNumedal and how the difficulty of making any headway finally drove him\\r\\nto emigrate to America.[41] The statement of another pioneer I quote\\r\\nin its entirety.[42] It is that of John Nelson Luraas, who came from\\r\\nTin in Telemarken, to Muskego, Wisconsin, in 1839, and in 1843 moved to\\r\\nDane County, Wisconsin. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I was my father\\'s oldest son, and consequently heir to the Luraas\\r\\n  farm. It was regarded as one of the best in that neighborhood,\\r\\n  but there was a $1,400 mortgage on it. I had worked for my father\\r\\n  until I was twenty-five years old, and had had no opportunity of\\r\\n  getting money. It was plain to me that I would have a hard time of\\r\\n  it, if I should take the farm with the debt resting on it, pay a\\r\\n  reasonable amount to my brothers and sisters, and assume the care\\r\\n  of my aged father. I saw to my horror how one farm after the other\\r\\n  fell into the hands of the lendsman and other money-lenders, and\\r\\n  this increased my dread of attempting farming. But I got married\\r\\n  and had to do something. Then it occurred to me that the best thing\\r\\n  might be to emigrate to America. I was encouraged in this purpose\\r\\n  by letters written by Norwegian settlers in Illinois who had lived\\r\\n  two years in America. Such were the causes that led me to emigrate\\r\\n  and I presume the rest of our company were actuated by similar\\r\\n  motives.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [41] _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pp. 82-83.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [42] _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pp. 6-7.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [43] In 1868, Mr. Luraas moved to Webster County, Iowa, returning\\r\\n       to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1873. I knew him in the early\\r\\n       nineties as a well-to-do retired farmer living in Stoughton,\\r\\n       Wisconsin. He died in 1894.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter written by Andreas Sandsberg at Hellen, Norway, September\\r\\ntwelfth, 1831, to Gudmund Sandsberg in Kendall, New York, the former\\r\\ncomplains of the hard times in Norway. In the spring of 1836 the second\\r\\nparty of emigrants from Stavanger County came to America. On the 14th\\r\\nof May of that year Andreas Sandsberg wrote his brother Gudmund in\\r\\nAmerica as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  A considerable number of people are now getting ready to go to\\r\\n  America from this Amt. Two brigs are to depart from Stavanger in\\r\\n  about eight days from now, and will carry these people to America,\\r\\n  and if good reports come from them, the number of emigrants will\\r\\n  doubtless be still larger next year. A pressing and general lack\\r\\n  of money entering into every branch of industry, stops or at least\\r\\n  hampers business and makes it difficult for many people to earn the\\r\\n  necessaries of life. While this is the case on this side of the\\r\\n  Atlantic there is hope for abundance on the other, and this I take\\r\\n  it, is the chief cause of this growing disposition to emigrate.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [44] Letter copied from the original by R. B. Anderson in 1896 and\\r\\n       printed in _First Chapter_, pp. 135-136.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Olson Menes, who came to America in 1845, is cited in\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_, 1870, page 130, as follows, illustrating the\\r\\nprominence of the economic cause nine years later:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The emigrants of the preceding year (1844) ... wrote home ... and\\r\\n  told of the fertility of the soil, the cheap prices of land and of\\r\\n  good wages. In a letter which I received from Iver Hove, he writes\\r\\n  that there they raise thirty-five bushels of wheat per acre, and\\r\\n  the grass is so thick that one can easily cut enough in one day for\\r\\n  winter feed for the cow. Such things fell to our liking, and many\\r\\n  looked forward with eager longing to the distant West, which was\\r\\n  pictured as the Eden that loving Providence had destined as a home\\r\\n  for the workingman of Norway, so oppressed with cares and want.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those here cited, Nattestad was from Numedal, Luraas from\\r\\nTelemarken, Menes from Sogn, while Sandsberg came from Ryfylke. But\\r\\nthe conditions were the same also in other provinces. In 1844, Hans\\r\\nC. Tollefsrude and wife emigrated from Land. Of the cause of his\\r\\nemigrating and that of early emigration from Land in general, his son\\r\\nChristian H. Tollefsrude of Rolfe, Iowa, writes me:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The causes were, no personal means and no prospect even securing a\\r\\n  home in their native district, Torpen, Nordre Land (letter of July\\r\\n  27, 1904).\\r\\n\\r\\nRev. Abraham Jacobson of Decorah, Iowa, a pioneer himself, writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Reasons for emigrating were mostly economic, very few if any\\r\\n  religious.... Wages here were at the very least double that in\\r\\n  Norway, and generally much more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the emigration from Ringsaker, I may cite Simon Simerson of Belmond,\\r\\nIowa:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The causes were economic. In the case of my parents, they came\\r\\n  here to create the home that they saw no chance of securing in the\\r\\n  mother country. (Letter of Oct. 12, 1904.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar evidence might be adduced for other districts and for all the\\r\\nolder settlements throughout the Northwest. At a meeting held at the\\r\\nhome of Ole O. Flom in Stoughton, Wisconsin, on July twenty-eighth,\\r\\n1908, when the present writer read a paper on \"Early Norwegian\\r\\nImmigration,\" testimony to the same effect was given by old pioneers\\r\\nthere present. There is no need of further multiplying the evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA highly developed spirit of independence has always been a dominant\\r\\nelement in the Scandinavian character,--I have reference here\\r\\nparticularly to his desire for personal independence, that is,\\r\\nindependence in his condition in life. Nothing is so repugnant to him\\r\\nas indebtedness to others and dependence on others. An able-bodied\\r\\nScandinavian who was a burden to his fellows was well-nigh unheard\\r\\nof. By the right of primogeniture the paternal estate would go to the\\r\\noldest son. The families being frequently large, the owning of a home\\r\\nwas to a great many practically an impossibility under wage conditions\\r\\nas they were in the North in the first half and more of the preceding\\r\\ncentury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the Scandinavian farmer\\'s son, with his love of personal\\r\\nindependence and his strong inherent desire to own a home, finding\\r\\nhimself so circumstanced in his native country that there was little\\r\\nhope of his being able to realize this ambition except in the distant\\r\\nuncertain future, listens, with a willing ear to descriptions of\\r\\nAmerica, with its quick returns and its great opportunities. And so\\r\\nhe decides to emigrate. And this he is free to do for the government\\r\\nputs no barrier upon his emigrating. This trait has impelled many a\\r\\nScandinavian to come and settle in America; and it is a trait that is\\r\\nthe surest guarantee of the character of his citizenship. Here, too, a\\r\\nsocial factor merits mention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the nobility was abolished in Norway in 1814, the lines between\\r\\nthe upper and lower classes, the wealthy and the poor, were tightly\\r\\ndrawn and social classes were well defined. And while Norway is today\\r\\nthe most democratic country in Europe, and Sweden and Denmark are\\r\\nalso thoroughly liberal (in part through the influence of America and\\r\\nAmerican-Scandinavians), a titled aristocracy still exists in these\\r\\ncountries. The extreme deference to those in superior station or\\r\\nposition that custom and existing conditions enforced upon those in\\r\\nhumbler condition was repugnant to them. Not infrequently have pioneers\\r\\ngiven this as one cause for emigrating in connection with that of\\r\\neconomic advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Causes of Emigration Continued. Special Factors.\\r\\n                Religion as a Cause. Emigration Agents._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the class of special causes which have influenced the Scandinavian\\r\\nemigration, political oppression has operated only in the case of the\\r\\nDanes in Southern Jutland.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [45] As a result of the Dano-Prussian war of 1864 Jutland below\\r\\n       Skodborghus became a province of Prussia. The greatly\\r\\n       increased taxes that immediately followed and the restrictions\\r\\n       imposed by the Prussian government upon the use of the\\r\\n       Danish language, as well as other oppressive measures that\\r\\n       formed a part of the general plan of the Prussianizing of\\r\\n       Sleswick-Holstein, drove large numbers of Danes away from\\r\\n       their homes, and most of these came to the United States. In\\r\\n       notes and correspondence from Denmark in Scandinavian-American\\r\\n       papers during these years complaints regarding such\\r\\n       regulations constantly appear, and figures of emigration of\\r\\n       Danes \"who did not wish to be Prussians\" are unusually large\\r\\n       for this period; for example in the foreign column of the\\r\\n       _Billed-Magazin_. The United States statistics also show a\\r\\n       sudden increase in the Danish immigration during the sixties\\r\\n       and the early seventies. From 1850-1861 not more than 3,983\\r\\n       had emigrated from Denmark; while in the thirteen years from\\r\\n       1862 to 1874 the number reached 30,978.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary service, which elsewhere has often played such an important\\r\\npart in promoting emigration, has, in the Scandinavian countries, been\\r\\nonly a minor factor, the period of service required being very short.\\r\\nNevertheless it has in not a few cases been a secondary cause for\\r\\nemigrating. Those with whom I have spoken who have given this as their\\r\\nmotive have, however, been mostly Norwegians and Swedes; but none of\\r\\nthose who belong to the earlier period of emigration give their desire\\r\\nto escape military service as a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious persecution has played a part in some cases, especially in\\r\\nNorway and Sweden. The state church is the Lutheran, but every sect\\r\\nhas been tolerated since the middle of the century, in Norway since\\r\\n1845. While few countries have been freer from the evil of active\\r\\npersecution because of religious belief, intolerance and religious\\r\\nnarrowness have not been wanting. In the beginning of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, the followers of the lay preacher, Hans Nielsen Hauge, in\\r\\nNorway were everywhere persecuted. Hauge himself was imprisoned in\\r\\nChristiania for eight years. And the Jansenists in Helsingland, Sweden,\\r\\nwere in the forties subjected to similar persecution. Thus Eric\\r\\nJansen was arrested several times for conducting religious meetings\\r\\nbetween 1842-1846,--though it must in fairness be admitted that his\\r\\nfirst arrest was undoubtedly provoked by the extreme procedure of the\\r\\ndissenters themselves. After having been put in prison repeatedly,\\r\\nJansen embarked for America in 1846 and became the founder of the\\r\\ncommunistic colony of followers at Bishopshille,[46] Henry County,\\r\\nIllinois. No such organized emigration took place among the Haugians,\\r\\nbut we have no means of knowing to what extent individual emigration of\\r\\nthe followers of Hauge took place during the three decades immediately\\r\\nafter his death. The well-known Elling Eielson, a lay preacher and\\r\\nan ardent Haugian, emigrated in 1839 to Fox River, La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, and many of those who believed in the methods of Hauge and\\r\\nEielson came to America in the following years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [46] So named from _Biskopskulla_, Jansen\\'s native place in Sweden.\\r\\n       See article by Major John Swainson on \"The Swedish Colony at\\r\\n       Bishopshill, Illinois,\" in Nelson\\'s _Scandinavians_, I, p.\\r\\n       142. This article gives an excellent account of the founding\\r\\n       of the Bishopshill settlement and Jansen\\'s connection with it.\\r\\n       See also _American Communities_ by Wm. Alfred Hinds, 1902, pp.\\r\\n       300-320.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was persecution also that drove many Scandinavian Moravians to\\r\\nAmerica in 1740 and 1747. Moravian societies had been formed in\\r\\nChristiania in 1737, in Copenhagen in 1739, in Stockholm in 1740, and\\r\\nin Bergen in 1740.[47] In 1735 German Moravians from Herrnhut, Saxony,\\r\\nestablished a colony at Savannah, Georgia.[47] In this colony there\\r\\nseem to have been some Danes and Norwegians. In 1740 a permanent colony\\r\\nwas located at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in 1747 one at Bethabara,\\r\\nNorth Carolina. Persecuted Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Moravians\\r\\ntook part in the founding of both these colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [47] _Decorah-Posten_, September 9, 1904, p. 5. See also above p. 37.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have seen, the first Norwegian settlement in America was\\r\\nestablished in Kendall, Orleans County, New York, in 1825. It has been\\r\\nclaimed that the \"sloopers\" were driven to emigrate by persecution at\\r\\nhome.[48] Another writer has shown that the only one of the Stavanger\\r\\nQuakers who suffered for his belief prior to 1826 was Elias Tastad,\\r\\nand he, it seems, did not emigrate.[49] The leader of the emigrants in\\r\\n_Restaurationen_, Lars Larson i Jeilane, had spent one year in London\\r\\nin the employ of the noted English Quaker, William Allen. In 1818,\\r\\nStephen Grellet, a French nobleman, who had become a Quaker in America,\\r\\nand William Allen preached in Stavanger.[49] The Quakers of Stavanger\\r\\nwere of the poorest of the people. It is highly probable, as another\\r\\nwriter states,[50] that Grellet, while there, suggested to them that\\r\\nthey emigrate to America where they could better their condition in\\r\\nmaterial things and at the same time practice their religion without\\r\\nviolating the laws of the country. The main motive was therefore\\r\\nprobably economic.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [48] R. B. Anderson is emphatic in this view. Pages 45-131 of his\\r\\n       _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_ are devoted to a\\r\\n       discussion of the sloop \"Restaurationen\" and the Quaker Colony\\r\\n       in Orleans County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [49] Nelson\\'s _History of Scandinavians_, 1901, p. 133.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [50] B. L. Wick, in _The Friends_, Philadelphia, 1894, according to\\r\\n       Nelson, p. 134. I have not been able to secure a copy of the\\r\\n       above article, therefore cannot here state the arguments, or\\r\\n       cite more fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is perfectly clear to me that not very many of the Orleans County\\r\\ncolonists were devout Quakers; for we soon find them wandering apart\\r\\ninto various other churches. Some returned to Lutheranism; those who\\r\\nwent west became mostly Methodists or Mormons; others did not join\\r\\nany church; while the descendants of those who remained are to-day\\r\\nMethodists. The Orleans County Quakers do not seem to have even erected\\r\\na meeting-house; and in Scandinavian settlements a church, however\\r\\nhumble, is, next to a home, the first thought.[51] Nevertheless the\\r\\nQuakers of Stavanger did suffer annoyances, and it must be remembered\\r\\nthat the leader of the expedition and the owner of the sloop was a\\r\\ndevout Quaker,[52] as were also at least two other leading members of\\r\\nthe party. Had it not been for these very men the party would probably\\r\\nnot have emigrated, at least not at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [51] The reader who knows Björnson\\'s _Synnöve Solbakken_ will\\r\\n       remember the author\\'s introduction of this feature in Chapter\\r\\n       II, the first two pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [52] Lars Larson settled in Rochester where he could attend a\\r\\n       Quaker church. The same is true of Ole Johnson, another of the\\r\\n       \"sloopers\" who later settled in Kendall but finally returned\\r\\n       to Rochester, where he died in 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much persecution of the early converts to the Baptist faith\\r\\nin Denmark between 1850-1860; and not a few of this sect emigrated. In\\r\\n1848 F. O. Nilson, one of the early leaders of the Baptist Church in\\r\\nSweden, was imprisoned and later banished from the country. He fled\\r\\nto Denmark, and in 1851 embarked for America. In the fifties Swedish\\r\\nBaptists in considerable numbers came to the United States because of\\r\\npersecution. There are, however, very few Norwegian Baptists, and I\\r\\nknow of no cases where persecution drove Baptists to leave Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nProselyting of some non-Lutheran churches in Scandinavia has been the\\r\\nmeans of bringing many Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes to this country.\\r\\nIn the fifties Mormon missionaries were especially active in Denmark\\r\\nand Norway. Their efforts did not seem to be attended by much success\\r\\nin Norway, though not a few converts were made among the Norwegians\\r\\nin the early settlements in Illinois and Iowa, as in the Fox River\\r\\nSettlement.[53] In Denmark, however, Mormon proselyting was more\\r\\nsuccessful than in Norway. All those who accepted Mormonism emigrated\\r\\nto America of course, and most of them to Utah. In the years 1851,\\r\\n1852, and 1853 there emigrated fourteen, three, and thirty-two Danes,\\r\\nrespectively, to this country. But in 1854 the number rose to 691, and\\r\\nin the following three years to 1,736. In 1850 there were in Utah two\\r\\nDanes; in 1870 there were 4,957. The first Norwegian to go to Utah\\r\\nprobably was Henrik E. Sebbe, who came to America in 1836, and went to\\r\\nUtah in 1848, where he became a Mormon.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [53] Some of the early Mormon leaders were Norwegians, however,\\r\\n       as Bishop Canute Peterson (Marsett), of Ephraim, Utah, who\\r\\n       came to America in 1837 from Hardanger, Norway. The slooper\\r\\n       Gudmund Haugaas became an elder in the church of the Latter\\r\\n       Day Saints in La Salle County, Illinois; he died in 1849 and\\r\\n       was succeeded by his son Thomas Haugaas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849 a Norwegian-American, O. P. Peterson, first introduced\\r\\nMethodism in Norway.[54] After 1855 a regular Methodist mission was\\r\\nestablished in Scandinavia under the supervision of a Danish-American,\\r\\nC. B. Willerup.[55] While the Methodist church has not prospered in\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries, especially in Denmark and Norway, there are\\r\\nlarge numbers of Methodists among the Scandinavian immigrants in this\\r\\ncountry,[56] and the early congregations were recruited for a large\\r\\npart from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [54] See a brief account by Rev. N. M. Liljegren in Nelson\\'s\\r\\n       _History of Scandinavians_, I, pp. 205-209.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [55] Methodism had been introduced into Sweden from England early\\r\\n       in the century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe efforts of steamship companies and emigration agents have been a\\r\\npowerful factor in promoting Scandinavian emigration. Through them\\r\\nliterature advertising in glowing terms the advantages of the New\\r\\nWorld was scattered far and wide in Scandinavia. Such literature often\\r\\ndealt with the prosperity of Scandinavians who had previously settled\\r\\nin America. Letters from successful settlers were often printed and\\r\\ndistributed broadcast. The early immigrants from the North settled\\r\\nlargely in Illinois, Wisconsin, and, a little later, in Iowa. As\\r\\nclearers of the forest and tillers of the soil they contributed their\\r\\nlarge share to the development of the country. None could better endure\\r\\nthe hardships of pioneer life on the western frontier. Knowing this,\\r\\nmany western states began to advertise their respective advantages in\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [56] By far the larger number, however, are Swedes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Causes of Emigration continued. The Influence of\\r\\n                Successful Pioneers. \"America-letters.\"\\r\\n                   The Spirit of Adventure. Summary._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFar more influential, however, than the factors just noted were the\\r\\nefforts put forth by successful immigrants to induce their relatives\\r\\nand friends to follow them. Numerous letters were written home praising\\r\\nAmerican laws and institutions, and setting forth the opportunities\\r\\nhere offered. These letters were read and passed around to friends.\\r\\nMany who had relatives in America would travel long distances to\\r\\nhear what the last \"America-letter\" had to report. Among the early\\r\\nimmigrants who did much in this way to promote emigration from their\\r\\nnative districts was one whom we have already spoken of, Gjert\\r\\nHovland. He wrote many letters home praising American institutions.\\r\\nThese letters \"were transcribed and the copies distributed far and\\r\\nwide in the Province of Bergen; and a large number were thus led to\\r\\nemigrate.\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [57] See _Billed-Magazin_, p. 74.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interviews in _Billed-Magazin_ contain statements from several\\r\\namong the early settlers on Koshkonong Prairie and the neighborhood\\r\\nof Stoughton which give evidence of the part that \"America-letters\"\\r\\nplayed in their emigration. On page 123 occurs a statement of Gaute\\r\\nIngbrigtson (Gulliksrud) who came from Tin in Telemarken in 1843 and\\r\\nbecame one of the earliest pioneers of Dunkirk Township in Dane County.\\r\\nHe says: \"Two of my uncles and a brother emigrated in 1839. I, however,\\r\\nremained at home with my father who was a farmer in the Parish of Tin.\\r\\nBut then letters came with good news from America, and my relatives as\\r\\nwell as other acquaintances on this side of the ocean were encouraged\\r\\nto emigrate. From this it came about that I and many others in my\\r\\nnative district prepared for leaving in the spring of 1843. The party\\r\\nnumbered about one hundred and twenty....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already had occasion to refer to a letter received by Ole\\r\\nMenes of Stoughton in 1845. Ingbrigt Helle came from Kragerö in\\r\\n1845 and settled in the Town of Dunn. The ship he came on brought\\r\\none hundred and forty immigrants and he mentions the fact that\\r\\nmany had been induced to emigrate by letters from America, and he\\r\\nwrites: \"Such letters from America urging emigration was, as far as\\r\\nI can see, the thing that brought the majority of emigrants to bid\\r\\nfarewell to Norway.\" Ole Knudson Dyrland, who emigrated from Siljord,\\r\\nTelemarken, in 1843, and became one of the earliest white settlers in\\r\\nDunn Township, Dane County, testifying to the same fact, mentions Ole\\r\\nKnudson Trovatten as one who, through letters, exerted considerable\\r\\ninfluence upon emigration in Telemarken (page 218, _Billed-Magazin_,\\r\\n1870). We shall meet Trovatten again below as a pioneer in the Town\\r\\nof Cottage Grove in the same county. The editor of _Billed-Magazin_\\r\\nwrites of Trovatten elsewhere, page 283, after giving a brief sketch of\\r\\nhis life: \"he settled on Koshkonong and wrote therefrom many letters\\r\\nto his numerous friends in his native country in which he, with\\r\\nmuch eloquence, made his countrymen acquainted with the glories of\\r\\nAmerica, and there is no doubt that Trovatten in a large measure gave\\r\\nthe impulse to the rapid development of emigration in the region of\\r\\nTelemarken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Trovatten\\'s influence as a promoter of immigration Gunder T. Mandt,\\r\\nhimself an immigrant of 1843 (died 1907, Stoughton, Wisconsin), gives\\r\\nsimilar testimony. He speaks of the opposition to emigration in Upper\\r\\nTelemarken, which found expression in all sorts of adverse accounts\\r\\nof America, especially among the clergy, and that much uncertainty\\r\\nprevailed among the masses as to the advisability of going to America.\\r\\nDuring all this, Trovatten, he says, \"came to be looked upon as an\\r\\nangel of peace, who had gone beforehand to the New World, whence he\\r\\nsent back home to his countrymen, so burdened by economic sorrows,\\r\\nthe olive-branch of promise, with assurances of a happier life in\\r\\nAmerica.... \\'Ole Trovatten has said so,\\' became the refrain in all\\r\\naccounts of the land of wonder, and in a few years he was the most\\r\\ntalked of man in Upper Telemarken. His letters from America gave a\\r\\npowerful impulse to emigration, and it is probable that hundreds of\\r\\nthose who now are plowing the soil of Wisconsin and Minnesota would\\r\\nstill be living in their ancestors\\' domains in the land of Harald\\r\\nFairhair, if they had not been induced to bid old Norway farewell\\r\\nthrough Trovatten\\'s glittering accounts of conditions on this side of\\r\\nthe ocean.\" (_Billed-Magazin_, 1870, p. 38.) Similar evidence of the\\r\\ninfluence of \"America-letters\" is also given by Knud Aslakson Juve, a\\r\\npioneer of 1844, in the Town of Pleasant Spring, in Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the preceding chapter I spoke of Gjert Hovland\\'s\\r\\nletters in 1835 as a chief factor in bringing about the emigration of\\r\\n1836. From settlers in other portions of the country comes testimony\\r\\nof similar nature, and I have spoken with many pioneers from a later\\r\\nperiod of immigration, whose coming was, in the last instance,\\r\\ndetermined by favorite accounts of America received from friends and\\r\\nrelatives already resident there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn letters from immigrants to their relatives at home prepaid tickets,\\r\\nor the price of the ticket, were often enclosed. This custom was so\\r\\ncommon as to become a special factor in emigration. According to\\r\\n_Norsk Folkeblad_ (cited in _Billed-Magazin_, p. 134), 4,000 Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants, via Christiana in 1868, took with them $40,335 (Speciedaler)\\r\\nin cash money of which $21,768 (Spd.) had been sent by relatives in\\r\\nAmerica to cover the expense of the journey. It has been estimated that\\r\\nabout fifty per cent of Scandinavian emigrants, arrive by prepaid\\r\\npassage tickets secured by relatives in this country.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [58] Nelson\\'s _History of Scandinavians_, page 56.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visits of successful Scandinavians back home was in the early days\\r\\nan important factor; and as a rule only those who had been prosperous\\r\\nwould return. In 1835 Knud Anderson Slogvig, who had emigrated in the\\r\\nsloop as we know, returned to Norway and became the chief promoter of\\r\\nthe exodus from the Province of Stavanger in 1836, which resulted in\\r\\nthe settlement at Fox River, La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already above, page 63, recited this fact and its significance\\r\\ntoward promoting further emigration from Stavanger Province and of\\r\\ninaugurating the first exodus from Hardanger also. Thus, while Jacob\\r\\nSlogvig, the brother, was one of a few to secure land in La Salle\\r\\nCounty and make the beginnings of settlement, Knud became the means\\r\\nof bringing hosts of immigrants from Norway to recruit the colony and\\r\\nstart it upon its course of growth. In precisely a similar way did two\\r\\nother brothers become even more significant factors in the foundation\\r\\nand development of the earliest Norwegian settlement in Wisconsin,\\r\\nnamely, that of Jefferson Prairie in Rock County. They were Ole and\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad, who had emigrated in 1837. Returning to Norway in\\r\\n1839 Ansten Nattestad became the father of emigration from Numedal,\\r\\nNorway, bringing with him a large party of immigrants, who located for\\r\\nthe most part in southern Rock County, Wisconsin, and adjacent parts of\\r\\nthe state of Illinois. But of this movement I shall have occasion to\\r\\nspeak more fully below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn equally interesting instance we have from a somewhat later period.\\r\\nWe have above referred to Ole Dyrland\\'s testimony of the effect of Ole\\r\\nTrovatten\\'s letters. After remarking that many still were doubtful of\\r\\nthe advisability of emigrating he goes on to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"But then Knud Svalestuen of Vinje, who had lived for a time in the\\r\\n  Muskego Settlement, came home on a trip back to Norway, and by his\\r\\n  accounts even the most hesitating were made firm in their faith.\\r\\n  Knud came in the fall of 1843, and during the winter he received\\r\\n  visits of men sent out from various districts in Telemarken, who\\r\\n  came to secure reliable information about the new country. The\\r\\n  next spring hosts of intending emigrants left the upper mountain\\r\\n  districts of the country.... Three emigrant ships left that year\\r\\n  from Porsgrund. On board the ship I left in there were two hundred\\r\\n  and eleven emigrants.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editor of _Billed-Magazin_ gives other interviews with pioneers\\r\\nshowing the effect of Svalestuen\\'s return (page 293).\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Norwegian pioneers wrote books regarding the settlements\\r\\nand American conditions, and these, laudatory as they were, exerted\\r\\nnot a little influence. Special mention should be made of Ole Rynning,\\r\\nwhose pamphlet, _Sandfaerdig Beretning om Amerika til Veiledning og\\r\\nHjaelp for Bonde og, Menigmand, skrevet of en Norsk som kom der i\\r\\nJuni Maaned_, 1837.[59] This little book of thirty-nine pages had\\r\\nnot a little to do with the emigration that followed to La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois, and elsewhere. In it the author gives an intelligent\\r\\ndiscussion of thirteen questions regarding America which he set himself\\r\\nto answer. Among them were: What is the nature of the country? What is\\r\\nthe reason that so many people go there? Is it not to be feared that\\r\\nthe land will soon be overpopulated? In what parts are the Norwegian\\r\\nsettlements? Which is the most convenient and the cheapest route to\\r\\nthem? What is the price of land? What provision is there for the\\r\\neducation of children? What language is spoken and is it difficult\\r\\nto learn? Is there danger of disease in America? What kind of people\\r\\nshould emigrate?\\r\\n\\r\\n  [59] _True Account of America for the Information and Help of\\r\\n       Peasant and Commoner_, written by a Norwegian who came there\\r\\n       in the month of June, 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother writer of immigration literature whose writings were widely\\r\\ndistributed and had considerable influence was Johan Reinert Reierson.\\r\\nHe came to America in 1843, but returned to Norway soon after. In\\r\\nAmerica he had written a book, _Veiviseren_,[60] which he published\\r\\nin Norway and was read far and wide. This book contains a fund of\\r\\ninformation regarding the different settlements, as Racine County,\\r\\nWisconsin, La Salle County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa, and others,\\r\\nall of which Reierson had himself visited. Reierson became the founder\\r\\nof the first Norwegian settlement in Texas in 1847-48.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [60] _The Pathfinder_, a book of one hundred and sixty-six pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the events leading up to this, _Billed-Magazin_ for 1870 gives a\\r\\ncircumstantial account, pages 58-60, 66-67, and 75-76. Reierson\\'s\\r\\nbook seems to have been a leading factor in promoting emigration from\\r\\nValders. Among the earliest to leave this region were Nils Hanson\\r\\nFjeld and family of South Aurdal, Valders, who emigrated in 1847. He\\r\\nsays, page 236 of _Billed-Magazin_ for 1870, that before him only\\r\\ntwo or three single men had gone to America from that region. The\\r\\n\"America-fever\" had not yet taken hold of the people, \"many would not\\r\\ngive credence to mere hearsay, but after a while a couple copies of\\r\\nReierson\\'s book about Texas came to the district. \\'Now we have the\\r\\nprinted word to go by,\\' it was said, and many of the doubters soon were\\r\\nconverted to the orthodox faith in the land of promise beyond the great\\r\\nocean.\" And as a result, many began to emigrate. As early as 1848,\\r\\nemigration from Valders on a considerable scale was already in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall here also mention Ansten Nattestad, who wrote a similar book,\\r\\nwhich he took with him on his return to Norway in 1838, and had printed\\r\\nthere; this became a factor operating toward emigration, especially\\r\\nin Numedal. Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson\\'s _Reise blandt de norske\\r\\nEmigranter i de forenede nordamerikanske Fristater_, Stavanger, 1846\\r\\n(124 pages), gave much valuable information about the settlements, but\\r\\nwas not calculated to exert much influence toward emigration. The first\\r\\nthree that I have mentioned, however, had an influence which we today\\r\\ncan hardly fully appreciate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, curiosity and the spirit of adventure have doubtless prompted\\r\\nsome to cross the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, the chief influences that have promoted Scandinavian\\r\\nemigration to the United States in the nineteenth century have been\\r\\nin the order of their importance: first, the prospect of material\\r\\nbetterment and the love of a freer and more independent life; second,\\r\\nletters of relatives and friends who had emigrated to the United\\r\\nStates and visits of these again to their native country; third, the\\r\\nadvertising of agents of emigration; fourth, religious persecution at\\r\\nhome; fifth, church proselytism; sixth, political oppression; seventh,\\r\\nmilitary service; and eighth, the desire for adventure. Fugitives from\\r\\njustice have been few, and paupers and criminals in the Scandinavian\\r\\ncountries are not sent out of the country; they are taken care of by\\r\\nthe government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Growth of the Fox River Settlement. The Immigration\\r\\n                  of 1836. Further Personal Sketches._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page fifty-five above I spoke of the advance troop of six men who\\r\\nestablished the Fox River Settlement in 1834. A list of those who\\r\\nfollowed from New York in 1835 was also given. Other settlers came\\r\\nin subsequent years, more and more now coming directly from Norway\\r\\nto La Salle County. The vicinity of the present towns of Norway and\\r\\nLeland, in eastern and northern La Salle County, became centers of\\r\\na settlement, which later extended east into Kendall County (Newark\\r\\nand Lisbon) and into Grundy County toward Morris, as also north into\\r\\nDeKalb County (Rollo, Sandwich), and northwest clear into southwestern\\r\\nLee County (Paw Paw, Sublette, and surrounding region). The slooper,\\r\\nOle Olson Hetletvedt, had not come west with the first party. He lived\\r\\nfirst in Kendall and then went to Niagara Falls, being there employed\\r\\nin a paper mill. Here he married a Miss Chamberlain, then moved back to\\r\\nOrleans County. In 1839 he and his wife went west, settling in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. He bought land on the spot where the town of Newark now stands.\\r\\nHe became well known as a lay preacher of the Haugian faith in the Fox\\r\\nRiver Settlement, also visiting the settlements founded soon after in\\r\\nWisconsin and in Lee County, Iowa. He died in Kendall County in 1849 or\\r\\n1850.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [61] One of his sons was Colonel Porter C. Olson of Civil War fame,\\r\\n       member of the Thirty-sixth Illinois Infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIver Waller, who bought a claim of Miss Pearson in 1835, came\\r\\ndirectly from Norway to La Salle County that year. Baldwin\\'s _History\\r\\nof La Salle County_ lists Ove Stenson Rossadal and wife, and John\\r\\nStenson Rossadal among the arrivals of 1835, and as being brothers\\r\\nof Daniel Rossadal, of whom we have spoken above. Strand\\'s _History\\r\\nof the Norwegians in Illinois_ correctly names them as sons of\\r\\nDaniel Rossadal. Nils Bilden, who also came during this period (year\\r\\nuncertain), was therefore one of the very first emigrants from\\r\\nHardanger to the United States. He settled at Rochester, Sangamon\\r\\nCounty, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the extent of Norwegian immigration during the years immediately\\r\\npreceding the year, 1836, which inaugurates a new period in the\\r\\nmovement, our information is very fragmentary. American statistics give\\r\\nforty-two and thirty-one, respectively, for 1834 and 1835, as the total\\r\\nimmigration from Norway and Sweden. In 1833 there were sixteen, while\\r\\nthe number for 1832 is three hundred and thirteen.[62] The total number\\r\\nbetween 1826 and 1831 is given as sixty-eight. It is probable, however,\\r\\nthat these figures do not represent the full number of immigrants\\r\\nduring these years. Norwegian government statistics on immigration\\r\\nwhich are available since 1836, give the number of immigrants for that\\r\\nyear as two hundred, which is also the figure for the following year.\\r\\nIt is to this exodus that we shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [62] Among those who came in 1832 was John Nordboe from\\r\\n       Gudbrandsdalen, Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have above, under Causes of Emigration, had occasion to speak of\\r\\nKnud Slogvig\\'s return to Norway in 1835, after a ten years\\' residence\\r\\nin America;[63] the results of his return were also there briefly\\r\\nnoted. In the two ships, _Norden_ and _Den Norske Klippe_,[64] which\\r\\nsailed from Stavanger in July of 1836, came two hundred immigrants,[65]\\r\\nwho located for the most part in the Fox River Settlement. These\\r\\nstopped en route for a short time in Rochester, no doubt gathering\\r\\nadvice and information from Lars Larson, the captain of the sloopers,\\r\\nresident there as we know; thence they continued their journey west\\r\\nto Chicago and to La Salle County. Thus the nucleus which had been\\r\\nformed in 1834-35 in a very short time developed into a considerable\\r\\nsettlement at a time when the surrounding country was practically a\\r\\nwilderness. The immigrants of 1836 were, in part, from Stavanger, some,\\r\\nhowever, were from other districts, east and north, as especially\\r\\nHardanger and Voss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [63] While in Norway he married a sister of Ole Olson Hetletvedt,\\r\\n       which may have been in part the purpose of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [64] _The North_ and _The Norwegian Rock_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [65] Langeland says a hundred and sixty on page eighteen of his\\r\\n       work, elsewhere a hundred and fifty. Two hundred seems,\\r\\n       however, to have been approximately the number.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all who came settled in Mission and the later Miller townships,\\r\\nhowever. Some went considerably farther north and established, in Adams\\r\\nTownship, a northern extension of the original settlement at and around\\r\\nthe present village of Leland. The two, however, later grew together\\r\\ninto one large settlement, extending also, east into Kendall County.\\r\\nThe first white settler in Adams Township was Mordicai Disney, who\\r\\nlocated there in 1836, slightly prior to the coming of the immigrants\\r\\nfrom Stavanger.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [66] Disney left again in 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of our immigrants to locate in Adams Township where Halvor\\r\\nNelson and Ole T. Olson, who in the spring of 1837, settled on sections\\r\\ntwenty-one and twenty-two;[67] they had lived in Mission Township\\r\\nsince their coming in 1836. Among those who came in 1836 and located\\r\\nin Mission Township were: Amund Anderson Hornefjeld, who in 1840 went\\r\\nto Wisconsin (see below), Erick Johnson Savig[68] and wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nfrom Kvinherred Parish, Knud Olson Hetletvedt and wife, Serena (both of\\r\\nwhom died of cholera in 1849), Osmund Thomason,[69] wife and daughter,\\r\\nAnne, Henrik Erickson Sebbe and two sons, who went to Salt Lake City in\\r\\n1848 (see above, p. 78). Samuel Peerson and Helge Vatname also seem to\\r\\nhave come in 1836; they are recorded as living at Norway, Illinois,\\r\\nin 1837, and as aiding in bringing some of the immigrants of 1837 from\\r\\nChicago to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [67] The Olson homestead is still owned by the son, Nels Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [68] Died in 1840, leaving wife and two children, John and Anna\\r\\n       Bertha; the latter later became the wife of John J. Næset in\\r\\n       the town of Christiana, Dane County, Wisconsin. Sævig was born\\r\\n       in 1803, his wife in 1809.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [69] Died in 1876, ninety-two years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of those who came in 1836 did not go directly to La Salle County.\\r\\nAndrew Anderson (Aasen), wife, Olena, three sons and two daughters,\\r\\nfrom Tysvær Parish, Skjold, remained two years in Orleans County,\\r\\nNew York, coming to La Salle County in 1838; he died of the cholera\\r\\nin 1849. John Hidle from Stavanger County, Norway, also emigrated in\\r\\n1836, coming direct to La Salle County. In 1838 he settled at Lisbon,\\r\\nKendall County, being thus the first Norwegian to locate there and as\\r\\nfar as I have been able to find out, the first Norwegian to settle in\\r\\nthat county (for Ole O. Hetletvedt did not come till 1839). Hidle,\\r\\nwho wrote his name Hill in this country, married Susanna Anderson,\\r\\ndaughter of Andrew Anderson; she was fourteen years old when her\\r\\nparents came to America, and is still living, at Morris, Illinois, with\\r\\nher daughter Mrs. Austin Osmond. Lars Bö and Michael Bö, who lived\\r\\nand died in La Salle County, came when John Hill did. Lars Larson\\r\\nBrimsöe, born in Stavanger, 1812, worked for some time as a carpenter\\r\\nin New York and Chicago before settling in La Salle County. In 1858 he\\r\\nlocated in Benton County, Iowa, and in 1872 went to Adams County (died\\r\\n1873). Björn Anderson Kvelve and wife, Catherine,[70] and two sons,\\r\\nArnold Andrew and Brunn, from Vikedal, Ryfylke, lived for a year in\\r\\nRochester, New York, came in 1837 to Mission Township, La Salle County.\\r\\nHe removed to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1839. Of Lars Tallakson, who\\r\\ncame to America in 1836 (by way of Gothenburg), we shall speak below.\\r\\nHerman Aarag Osmond, born near Stavanger, 1818, also came to America in\\r\\n1836. He first lived in Ohio, came in 1837 to Chicago, then to Norway,\\r\\nLa Salle County. He settled on a farm near Norway in 1848, but bought\\r\\nin 1869 a farm near Newark, Kendall County; Herman Osmond died in\\r\\nNewark in 1888.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [70] Abel Catherine von Krogh was born in 1809. Her father was\\r\\n       Arnold von Krogh. Björne Anderson Kvelve was born in 1801. For\\r\\n       a sketch of Björn Anderson and his wife see pages 155-170 of\\r\\n       _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_ by R. B. Anderson,\\r\\n       who is their third son (b. 1846 in Albion, Wisconsin); I am\\r\\n       indebted to this work for many facts relative to the Illinois\\r\\n       pioneers of 1836-1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the immigrants of 1836 located in Chicago, which then consisted\\r\\nof only a few houses. Among these was first, Halstein Torison (or\\r\\nTörison), to whom Knud Langeland accords the distinction of being\\r\\nthe first Norwegian resident of Chicago. He was from Fjeldberg in\\r\\nSöndhordland, and he came to Chicago with wife and children in October,\\r\\n1836. The site of his home was that now occupied by the Chicago and\\r\\nNorthwestern Depot on Wells Street. He worked first as a gardener\\r\\nfor a Mr. Newberry. Reverend Dietrichson speaks of him, in 1844, as\\r\\nprosperous and as occupying a leading position among Chicago Norwegians\\r\\nat that time. In 1848 he moved to Calumet, twenty miles south of\\r\\nChicago, where he lived until his death in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvein Lothe, from Hardanger, also came in 1836, as did Nils Röthe and\\r\\nwife, Torbjör, who were from Voss. The latter remained, however, in\\r\\nRochester, New York, one year before coming to Chicago. Nils Röthe and\\r\\nwife were the first to emigrate from Voss, Norway. Johan Larson, from\\r\\nKopervik, an island not far north of Stavanger city, also located in\\r\\nChicago in 1836. He was a sailor and had, it seems, visited Chicago\\r\\nbefore; what year he came to America, I do not know. I may also mention\\r\\nBaard Johnson, who, with his wife and five children, settled in Chicago\\r\\nin 1837. Those we have mentioned form the nucleus out of which has\\r\\ngrown today the largest Norwegian city colony in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvein Knutson Lothe, who emigrated with wife and two children from\\r\\nHardanger in 1836, was from the Parish of Ullensvang. There were\\r\\neleven persons in all who came from Ullensvang that year, the other\\r\\nseven being: Jon Jonson Aga, wife and two children, Torbjörn Djönne,\\r\\nOlav Öystenson Lofthus and Omund Helgeson Maakestad. Maakestad became\\r\\nthe founder of the Hardanger settlement in Lee County, Illinois (see\\r\\nbelow). I am not able to say where Aga, Djönne or Lofthus located.\\r\\nThere were also seven immigrants from Ulvik Parish, Hardanger, that\\r\\nyear; they were: Sjur Haaheim and wife, Paul Dale and wife, Sjur Dale\\r\\nand wife and Aslak Holven. These eighteen persons form the advance\\r\\nguard of the immigration from Hardanger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have spoken of the two ships that came from Stavanger in 1836.\\r\\nThese were followed in the next year by _Enigheden_ (Harmony), Captain\\r\\nJensen, carrying ninety-three passengers. These were for the most part\\r\\nfrom Tysvær and from Hjelmeland, and Aardal in Ryfylke, from the city\\r\\nof Stavanger, and from Egersund. They came to New York, thence went to\\r\\nAlbany and Rochester, and by way of the lakes to Chicago. Most of them\\r\\nwent to La Salle County, although not all settled there permanently.\\r\\nAmong the passengers were Hans Valder and wife from Ryfylke, Knud Olson\\r\\nEide, Ole Thompson Eide, from Fogn, near Stavanger, Thomas A. Thompson,\\r\\nChristopher Danielson and family, Östen Espeland and family, and Knud\\r\\nDanielson and family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailing of _Enigheden_ may be regarded as a continuation of the\\r\\nmovement in Stavanger county, which was given such an impetus by Knud\\r\\nSlogvig\\'s return in 1835. Other immigrants continued to come from this\\r\\nregion in subsequent years, but the autumn of 1837 inaugurates a change\\r\\nin the course of the movement to a more northerly region, Hardanger,\\r\\nVoss, and Bergen, for a period, contributing a large share to the now\\r\\nrapidly increasing numbers of emigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n                 _The Year 1837. The Sailing of Aegir._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of Gjert Hovland in this new trend in the immigration\\r\\nshould be noted. South Bergenhus now became the scene of immigration\\r\\nactivity. At the same time it is to be observed that Hardanger had\\r\\ncontributed its quota of immigrants in the exodus of 1836. The return\\r\\nof Knud Slogvig was noised far beyond the County of Stavanger. Among\\r\\nthose who travelled long distances to see and talk with Slogvig and\\r\\nget personal affirmation of what reports had told of America, was Nils\\r\\nP. Langeland, a school teacher from Samnanger, one of the emigrants of\\r\\n1837. Similarly Knud Langeland relates in _Nordmaendene i Amerika_,\\r\\npage twenty-three, how he paid a visit to Slogvig in the winter of\\r\\n1836, and received from him assurance of what he had read[71] about\\r\\nthe New World. Knud Langeland gives a most interesting account of how\\r\\nhis interest in America became aroused; though a personal experience,\\r\\nit is undoubtedly typical of that of many a young man in Bergen and\\r\\nsurrounding region at this time. As a document in immigration history,\\r\\nit is sufficiently significant to warrant quoting in considerable part.\\r\\nHe says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Purely by accident I found in a friend\\'s library in Bergen a book\\r\\n  by a German entitled REISEN IN AMERIKA.... As this book contained\\r\\n  some vivid pictures of the distant regions the traveller had\\r\\n  visited, as well as of the impressions he had received of land and\\r\\n  people in the new world, it was read with all the allurements of a\\r\\n  novel. Here was given full information about the German emigration.\\r\\n  With this description of travels in my pocket I went early one\\r\\n  summer morning along the bay of Solem and up the steep ascent\\r\\n  of Lyderhorn. Up there I read and dreamed of the new wonderful\\r\\n  world far away to the west. The mist had sunk low over the fjords\\r\\n  between the isles about Bergen, but up there around the tree-tops\\r\\n  it was bright sunshine. It was the first time I had seen this\\r\\n  glorious sight peculiar to mountain regions. If any prosaic nature\\r\\n  ever received poetic inspiration and exaltation it was during\\r\\n  this time, while my eyes beheld the sunlit surface of the fog and\\r\\n  in the distance caught a glimpse of the sparkling shield of the\\r\\n  North Sea, which seemed to rise to the height of the mountain....\\r\\n  And far out toward the west, thousands of miles out there, lies\\r\\n  the land about which I am reading, lies the big, still so little\\r\\n  known part of the world, with its secrets and its wonders. From\\r\\n  that time I sought all books and descriptions of travel concerning\\r\\n  America which I could get, and, together with an uncle of mine, I\\r\\n  began to collect as much information about the new world, as well\\r\\n  through books as through the verbal accounts from Stavanger people,\\r\\n  which now began to be current in the district concerning Kleng\\r\\n  Peerson\\'s emigration and return, without our yet actually thinking\\r\\n  of emigrating. Through a kind friend\\'s help I was enabled in 1834\\r\\n  to spend six months in England, on which occasion I gathered a\\r\\n  number of pamphlets and books about America and emigration from\\r\\n  England. In this way more definite and more reliable information as\\r\\n  to conditions in America and the journey thither gradually spread\\r\\n  in the vicinity. This seemed to discredit the many ridiculous and\\r\\n  impossible stories now constantly set in circulation. Slowly but\\r\\n  steadily the thought of emigrating to America took root; more and\\r\\n  more joined the little group which now in earnest began talking\\r\\n  of selling their homes and going to America. Then it was that the\\r\\n  bishop of Bergen wrote a letter to the farmers of Bergen on the\\r\\n  text, \"Remain in the country; make your living honorably,\" whether\\r\\n  he forgot it or did not regard it suitable to the occasion, he\\r\\n  failed to quote the second commandment of the passage: \"Multiply\\r\\n  and fill the world.\" The latter the farmers had adhered to; most\\r\\n  of them had large families, and since the land at home was filled,\\r\\n  while they now heard that a large part of the new world was\\r\\n  unsettled, they decided to disobey the bishop\\'s advice and go to\\r\\n  the new Canaan, where flowed milk and honey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [71] Especially in a German book on travels in America, see his\\r\\n       account, p. 21. Knud Langeland did not emigrate, however,\\r\\n       before 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far Langeland\\'s account. While the evidence points to many causes as\\r\\noperating conjointly toward bringing about the departure, in the spring\\r\\nof 1837, of so many from Samnanger and from Voss, the influence of Nils\\r\\nP. Langeland, already mentioned above, seems to have been a special\\r\\nfactor at this particular time. Nils Langeland was already then an\\r\\nelderly man. He had devoted his life to the cause of popular education,\\r\\nbut the intolerant clergy of the time found him too liberal minded and\\r\\ncontinually put obstacles in his way. Although he was supported by a\\r\\ngroup of faithful friends, his usefulness was hampered; discouraged at\\r\\nlast, he decided to leave his native country and go to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was in the summer of 1836. In the fall of that year, Captain\\r\\nBehrens returned with the bark, _Aegir_, from America, whither he\\r\\nhad carried a cargo of freight in the summer. Langeland\\'s friends\\r\\nhad already sold their homes and were preparing to emigrate. Hearing\\r\\nof this, Behrens decided to convert his bark into a passenger boat,\\r\\nand he offered to take them to America the next spring; the offer\\r\\nwas accepted. While preparations were going on, the announcements of\\r\\nthe projected sailing, which had been printed in the newspapers, led\\r\\nintending immigrants from other sections, also, to join the party.\\r\\nAmong these was Ole Rynning, from Snaasen, in Trondhjem Province, of\\r\\nwhom we shall speak more at length below.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 4th of July, 1837, _Aegir_ sailed from Bergen with eighty-two\\r\\npassengers. Among these were Mons Aadland, Nils Fröland, Anders\\r\\nNordvig, Ingebrigt Brudvig, Thomas Bauge and Thorbjörn Veste, all of\\r\\nwhom had large families, and the following from Hardanger: Nils L.\\r\\nJördre, wife and six children, and Peder J. Maurset, wife and child,\\r\\nfrom Ulvik Parish, and Amund Rosseland, wife and three children, Lars\\r\\nG. Skeie, wife and two children, Sjur E. Rosseland and Svein L. Midthus\\r\\nfrom Vikör. The last-named were the first to emigrate from Vikör. The\\r\\nparty further included Halle Væte, wife and grown daughter, and the\\r\\nfollowing persons: Odd J. Himle, Kolbein O. Saue, Styrk O. Saue, Nils\\r\\nL. Bolstad, Baard Haugen, John H. Björgo, Ole Dyvik, all of whom were\\r\\nmarried, besides several single men, mostly relatives of the above,\\r\\nnamely: Dövig, Bauge, Fröland, Nordvig, Hisdal, Tösseland, et al. Each\\r\\nadult paid sixty dollars (Norwegian specie) for passage, children under\\r\\ntwelve paying half price. They arrived in New York eight weeks later.\\r\\nThe journey inland was attended by numerous expenses for which the\\r\\nimmigrants were not prepared. When they had gotten as far as Detroit,\\r\\nthe above-mentioned Nils P. Langeland found himself without the\\r\\nnecessary means to continue the journey. His friends who had offered to\\r\\npay his expenses as far as Chicago, at last became discouraged over the\\r\\nconstant demands upon their funds and Langeland was obliged to remain\\r\\nin Detroit. Here, being a capable carpenter, he soon found work; later\\r\\nhe removed to Lapeer County, Michigan, bought there 120 acres of land,\\r\\nplying at the same time the trade of a carpenter. Thus it came about\\r\\nthat Nils Langeland became the first Norwegian to settle in the State\\r\\nof Michigan, though we have seen that Kleng Peerson had visited the\\r\\nstate four years earlier. At least three others of the immigrants of\\r\\n1837 located temporarily in the State of Michigan that year, namely,\\r\\nIngebright Nordvig, Östen Espeland, who had come in _Enigheden_, and\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland. These went to Adrian, Lenawee County, but left again\\r\\nsoon after. We shall meet Bjaaland again in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nand on Koshkonong Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n                      _Beaver Creek. Ole Rynning._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigrants who came in the _Aegir_ seem to have intended to settle\\r\\nin La Salle County, but in Chicago were advised by two Americans not to\\r\\ngo there. They were also partly influenced by Norwegian immigrants[72]\\r\\nwho were dissatisfied with that locality, and who recommended Iroquois\\r\\nCounty as a more desirable location to settle. They were told that the\\r\\nFox River Valley was a very unhealthy place, the settlers were dying of\\r\\nague and fever, and it was a misfortune that they had ever been induced\\r\\nto locate there. (Knut Langeland also records the fact that the fever\\r\\nraged in the whole of the Fox River Valley from Muskego, in Wisconsin,\\r\\nto the Mississippi River in Illinois, that summer, but that the\\r\\ncondition in La Salle was no worse than elsewhere). So the intending\\r\\nsettlers deputed three men to explore the country for a site for a new\\r\\ncolony.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [72] Björn Anderson seems to have in part been instrumental in\\r\\n       their not going to La Salle County, but there is no evidence\\r\\n       that he recommended Iroquois County as far as I am aware.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese, Ole Rynning, Ingebrigt Brudvig and Ole Nattestad,[73] walked\\r\\nsouth along the line of the present Illinois Central Railroad,\\r\\nselecting the location at Beaver Creek in Iroquois County. Of the\\r\\nfurther history of this unfortunate and short lived colony, the\\r\\nreader may find an account in Dietrichson\\'s brief discussion of the\\r\\nsettlement, or in Langeland\\'s or R. B. Anderson\\'s book. The majority of\\r\\nthe settlers died during the spring in the low and unhealthy climate.\\r\\nOle Rynning himself died and lies buried there. The few survivors\\r\\nleft for La Salle County the following spring. Mons Aadland refused,\\r\\nhowever, to go. He remained in Beaver Creek three years longer; selling\\r\\nhis land in 1840 for a herd of cattle and, moving north, he located in\\r\\nRacine County, being therefore one of the earliest pioneers in this\\r\\npart of Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [73] Niels Veste may also have been of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Rynning\\'s name is most closely associated with the brief history of\\r\\nthe Beaver Creek Settlement. We have already seen above how his book,\\r\\n_Sandfaerdig Beretning om Amerika_, came to have a very far-reaching\\r\\ninfluence upon Norwegian emigration. This book Rynning wrote that\\r\\nwinter in the Beaver Creek Settlement. It was printed in Norway the\\r\\nnext year. It soon became widely distributed and continued for over a\\r\\ndecade to exert a powerful influence upon Norwegian emigration from\\r\\nVoss, east to Hedemarken, and north to Gudbrandsdalen, in these latter\\r\\nprovinces, at the close of the decade, especially.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have, on page 86 above, observed that Rynning formulated certain\\r\\nquestions which he set about answering for the information of intending\\r\\nimmigrants. It will be of interest to note here the nature of some\\r\\nof his answers. The first question as to the nature of the country,\\r\\nhe answers by giving a very intelligent account of the topography and\\r\\nclimate of the country, the soil in the different parts, and of what\\r\\nthe produce of the different sections consists. In answer to the third\\r\\nquestion, he says that the United States is more than twenty times as\\r\\nlarge as Norway, that the greater part of the country is not yet even\\r\\nunder cultivation, and that there is room for a population more than\\r\\na hundred times as great as that of Norway. There need be no fear, he\\r\\nsays, that the country will be full in fifty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth question as to where the Norwegian immigrants have located\\r\\nespecially, he answers by saying, that in New York, Rochester, Detroit,\\r\\nChicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans, there are said to be individual\\r\\nsettlers; but he mentions four places where several have settled,\\r\\nnamely: (1) Orleans County, New York, but where, he says, there are now\\r\\nonly two or three families left; (2) La Salle County, Illinois, where,\\r\\nhe says, there are about twenty families; (3) White County, Indiana, on\\r\\nthe Tippecanoe River. \"Here,\" he says, live \"only two Norwegians from\\r\\nDrammen, who, together, own about eleven hundred acres of land\"; (4)\\r\\nShelby County, Missouri, where a few Norwegians from Stavanger settled\\r\\nin the spring of 1837; (5) Iroquois County, Illinois. \"Here,\" he says,\\r\\n\"there are eleven or twelve families of those who came last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth question as to the land in these localities, he answers by\\r\\npraising the beauty and the fertility of the prairie. And as to the\\r\\nprice of land, he says, that it has hitherto been $1.25 per acre, but\\r\\nthat he has heard that hereafter land is to be divided into three\\r\\nclasses and the price of land of the third class is to be half a dollar\\r\\nan acre. He then offers explicit directions as to how to go about\\r\\nsecuring land. He thereupon gives the prices of livestock at the time,\\r\\nand of produce, etc. A horse, we learn, costs from fifty to a hundred\\r\\ndollars, a yoke of oxen, sixty to eighty. A milk cow with calf, sixteen\\r\\nto twenty, a sheep, two to three, hogs are six to ten dollars a head,\\r\\npork costs three to five shillings a \"mark,\" butter six to twelve, a\\r\\nbarrel of (wheat) flour, eight to ten dollars; a barrel of cornmeal,\\r\\ntwo and a half to three dollars; a barrel of potatoes, one dollar; a\\r\\npound of coffee, twenty shillings; a barrel of salt is five dollars\\r\\n(Norwegian). But in Wisconsin Territory, the prices are two to three\\r\\ntimes higher, while farther south, everything is cheaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he speaks of wages, of religious conditions, law and order, how\\r\\ninstruction for the young is provided, linguistic conditions, health\\r\\nconditions. He discusses life in the new settlements, its trials and\\r\\nattendant evils. As to the Indians, he says: \"They have gone farther\\r\\nwest; one need never fear attack by Indians in Illinois.\" In answer to\\r\\nthe question as to who should emigrate, he warns against unreasonable\\r\\nexpectations; advises farmers, mechanics and tradesmen to come, he who\\r\\nneither can nor will work must never expect, he says, that wealth or\\r\\nluxury will stand ready to receive him. No, in America one gets nothing\\r\\nwithout work, but by work, one can expect to attain to comfortable\\r\\ncircumstances. He thereupon discusses the question of the dangers in\\r\\ncrossing the oceans, which, he says, are less than usually imagined,\\r\\nand the rumor of enslavement of the immigrant. The latter he brands\\r\\nas false, adding, \"yet it is true that many who have not been able\\r\\nto pay their passage, have come upon such terms that they have sold\\r\\nthemselves, or their service, for a certain number of years to some\\r\\nman here in the country. Many are thereby said to have come into bad\\r\\nhands, and have not had it better than slaves. No Norwegian, as far as\\r\\nI know, has fared in this way, nor is it to be feared, if one crosses\\r\\nby a Norwegian ship, and with one\\'s own countrymen.\" In conclusion, I\\r\\nshall cite his opinion on the slave trade which is interesting in the\\r\\ninsight and judgment it gives evidence of, on the part of an immigrant\\r\\nover twenty years before the war:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The northern states are trying in every congress to abolish slavery\\r\\n  in the southern states; but as these always oppose it and appeal\\r\\n  to their right to govern their own internal affairs, there will\\r\\n  probably soon take place a separation between the northern and the\\r\\n  southern states, or else there will be internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Rynning was born in Ringsaker, as the son of Reverend Jens Rynning\\r\\nand wife, Severine Catherine Steen, in 1809. In 1825, the father moved\\r\\nto Snaasen. Having finished his education in 1829, he taught school for\\r\\na time. Then he bought a small farm[74] which he had to give up again,\\r\\nnot being able to pay for it. His ultra democratic sympathies were\\r\\ndispleasing to his conservative father, and an unhappy love affair,\\r\\nwhich his father disapproved of as being a mesalliance, seems, at\\r\\nleast, to have been, in part the cause of his leaving Norway. We have\\r\\nrecited, briefly, his short career in America.[75] Of his nobility of\\r\\ncharacter and the self-sacrificing spirit he showed in helping the\\r\\ngrief-stricken and suffering colonists in the unfortunate Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement, in the spring and summer of 1838, his surviving associates\\r\\ngive ample testimony. His book, _Sandfaerdig Beretning_, was written\\r\\non the sick-bed.[76] When he died, there was only one man in the\\r\\nsettlement who was well enough to make a casket for him from an old oak\\r\\nwhich he hewed down. Rynning was buried out on the prairie, but no one\\r\\nknows now where the spot is.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [74] This he bought of the father of Rev. B. G. Muus, well-known in\\r\\n       Norwegian-American church history, and a long time pastor at\\r\\n       Norway, Goodhue County, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [75] See above p. 103.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [76] Ansten Nattestad, of whom below, took it with him to Norway\\r\\n       that year and got it printed in Christiania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _Some of the Immigrants of 1837. The First Pathfinders\\r\\n                     from Numedal and Telemarken._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the 177 immigrants, who came to America from Stavanger and\\r\\nBergen in 1837, there was a considerable number who embarked from\\r\\nGothenburg, Sweden. These came mostly from Numedal and Telemarken in\\r\\nthe south central part of Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1837 were, also, the brothers, Ole and Ansten\\r\\nNattestad, from Vægli, Numedal, both of whom came via Gothenburg, and\\r\\nHans Barlien, who emigrated with _Enigheden_. These men played such a\\r\\npart in the immigration history of the period as to deserve something\\r\\nmore than a mere mention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad may be regarded as the father of the emigration\\r\\nmovement from Numedal, Norway, from which some of the most successful\\r\\nNorwegian settlements in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, were later\\r\\nrecruited. His brother, Ole Nattestad, became the founder of one of\\r\\nthese settlements, that of Jefferson Prairie, in Rock County, Wisconsin\\r\\n(also extending into Illinois); while Hans Barlien founded the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in Iowa, at Sugar Creek, Lee County. Of the\\r\\ncircumstances which led to the emigration of the Nattestad brothers, an\\r\\ninteresting account appears in _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pages 82-83.\\r\\nThis, which is an interview with Ole Nattestad, has been reprinted in\\r\\nother works and I shall not take the space for it here. We may note,\\r\\nhowever, that they had received their first news of America upon a\\r\\njourney to the neighborhood of Stavanger in the close of 1836. During\\r\\nChristmas of that year, they were the guests of Even Nubbru in Sigdal,\\r\\na member of the Storthing, and it was his praise of American laws which\\r\\nfirst aroused Ole Nattestad\\'s desire to emigrate, as he had already had\\r\\nsome unpleasant experiences in that respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, 1837, they stood ready to leave for America, having converted\\r\\ntheir possessions into cash, a sum of eight hundred dollars. They\\r\\nwent on _skis_ from Rollaug to Tin, over the mountains and through\\r\\nthe forests to Stavanger. Halsten Halvorson Brække-Eiet, also from\\r\\nRollaug, became a third member of the party. In Stavanger, local\\r\\nofficial hostility to emigration led them into difficulties, and they\\r\\nwere forced to seek safety in flight by night. They went to Tananger,\\r\\nwhere they were more successful, a skipper contracting to take them in\\r\\nhis yacht to Gothenburg. In Gothenburg, they secured passage with a\\r\\nship which carried iron from Sweden to Fall River, Massachusetts. The\\r\\njourney lasted thirty-two days. Thence, they went to New York, where\\r\\nthey met a few Norwegians, and thence again to Rochester. Here they\\r\\nspoke with several members of the sloop party of 1825, now living in\\r\\nRochester, and they were, for a short time, the guests of Lars Olson,\\r\\nas so many others of the immigrants of those years. Hearing that those\\r\\nwho had come to America in 1836 had gone west to La Salle County, they\\r\\ndecided to go there. In Detroit, Ole Nattestad was one day walking\\r\\nabout to view the city, and he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Here I accidentally came upon a man, whom I immediately recognized\\r\\n  by his clothes as a countryman from the western coast of Norway. I\\r\\n  greeted the man, and the meeting was for us both as if two brothers\\r\\n  had met after a long separation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man was one of the passengers on the _Aegir_, who had just then\\r\\narrived in Detroit. The Nattestad party now joined these, all (except\\r\\nN. P. Langeland and family, as we have seen, page 102 above), going\\r\\nwest to Chicago. Here they met Björn Anderson Kvelve, whose unfavorable\\r\\naccount of the Fox River locality first gave them some doubt as to the\\r\\nwisdom of going there. Of the subsequent events, the reader has already\\r\\nbeen told. We shall meet again with both Ole and Ansten Nattestad\\r\\nbelow. Halsten Brække-Eiet later settled in Dodgeville, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans Barlien was from Overgaarden, Trondhjem; he seems to have been\\r\\nthe second emigrant to America from that region. Of him there will\\r\\nbe occasion to speak more in detail in connection with the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in Iowa. I desire, here, however, to mention five\\r\\nothers, who came via Gothenburg to America in the same year, namely,\\r\\nErick Gauteson Midböen, Thore Kittilson Svimbil, and John Nelson Rue,\\r\\nwho had large families, and two single men, Gunder Gauteson Midböen\\r\\nand Torsten Ingebrigtson Gulliksrud. These form the advance troupe\\r\\nof emigrants from the Parish of Tin in Upper Telemarken, a region\\r\\nwhich furnished a large share of recruits for the pioneer colonies\\r\\nof Wisconsin and Iowa in the forties and the fifties. Thore Svimbil\\r\\nbecame a pioneer in Blue Mounds, Dane County, where we shall find him\\r\\nlater. Erik Gauteson Midböen, who had a large family, settled in La\\r\\nSalle County, but, says our authority, \"fortune was not kind to him.\"\\r\\nHe later joined the Latter Day Saints and undertook a journey to Norway\\r\\nas a representative of that church, returned to America and died soon\\r\\nafter, about 1850, as near as I can ascertain. Torsten Gulliksrud\\r\\nalso settled in Illinois, but died early. John Nelson Rue will appear\\r\\nlater in our account as one of the founders of the earliest Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement in Winneshiek County, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not know what the circumstances were that led to the emigration\\r\\nof this little group from Upper Telemarken in 1837. It seems not\\r\\nunlikely that the news of America had come to them through copies\\r\\nof letters from Hovland or others, though they may also have had\\r\\ninformation more directly through Knud Slogvig\\'s return. The latter\\r\\ndoes not to me seem so likely, however, for they appear to have made\\r\\nno attempt to secure passage from Stavanger. The departure of this\\r\\ngroup from Tin does not seem to have had any immediate influence upon\\r\\nemigration from that region. The real exodus from Tin does not begin\\r\\ntill 1839, and then as a part of the general movement, but this may\\r\\nhave been aided by letters from those who went thence in 1837. The\\r\\nnumber that in this way took passage via Gothenburg that year may have\\r\\nbeen larger than we have knowledge of. While the number, two hundred,\\r\\nwhich our statistics, cited above, gives as that of the emigration from\\r\\nNorway in 1837 is certainly rather low, it is highly improbable that it\\r\\nwas as high as three hundred, as elsewhere given. A conservative and\\r\\nreasonable estimate would seem to place it at about two hundred and\\r\\nforty or fifty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on the _Aegir_, we mentioned Nils Fröland. He\\r\\nwas one of two, the other being Mons Aadland, to first join Nils P.\\r\\nLangeland in his preparations for emigrating to America. With his\\r\\nwife and children, he located at Beaver Creek, and they were among\\r\\nthe fortunate survivors of that colony. In 1839, he moved to Mission\\r\\nTownship in La Salle County, and to the present Miller Township the\\r\\nnext year. He died there in 1873. His widow (born 1798) was still\\r\\nliving in 1895. A grandson, Lars Fruland, resides at Newark, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnders Nordvig, who also came on the _Aegir_, died in the Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement. His widow, a sister of Knud Langeland, moved to La Salle\\r\\nCounty; she died there at the age of ninety in 1892. A daughter,\\r\\nMalinda, married Iver Lawson (Iver Larson Bö), who came to Chicago\\r\\nfrom Voss, Norway, in 1844. Victor F. Lawson, owner of _The Chicago\\r\\nNews_, is her son. Another daughter, Sarah (born 1824), married a Mr.\\r\\nDarnell, a pioneer of Benton County, Iowa, in 1854. Mrs. Darnell was\\r\\nthe first Norwegian in that county. After Darnell\\'s death, she returned\\r\\nto Illinois, locating at Sandwich, De Kalb County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on _Aegir_, Odd Himle, Baard Haugen, Ole Dyvik\\r\\nand John Björgo went direct to La Salle County. The first of these\\r\\nreturned to Norway in 1844, and, while there, married Marie L. Jermo;\\r\\nhe returned to America in 1845, and settled on Spring Prairie in\\r\\nColumbia County, Wisconsin, where we shall meet with him again. He died\\r\\nin De Forest, Dane County, Wisconsin, in May, 1893. We shall also meet\\r\\nJohn Björgo below as one of the pioneers of Koshkonong, Wisconsin.\\r\\nHalle Væte died in Beaver Creek, as did his wife and grown-up\\r\\ndaughter. Kolbein Saue and Styrk Saue both went to Beaver Creek and\\r\\nwere among the survivors; they came to Koshkonong in 1843 and are to\\r\\nbe remembered among the early pioneers there. Styrk Saue was born in\\r\\nVoss, September twenty-fifth, 1814; his wife, Ellen Olson (born Rekve),\\r\\nwas born in 1816. They were married in America. Nils Bolstad settled\\r\\nin Koshkonong in 1840. He was one of a group of three to visit Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, on a trip of exploration in the fall of 1839, being,\\r\\ntherefore, the first Norwegians in that county.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on _Enigheden_ was Hans Valder and wife. He was\\r\\nborn on the farm, Vælde, in Vats Parish in Ryfylke in 1813. Having\\r\\nreceived an education he taught school in Tysvæer some years before\\r\\nemigrating. Here he heard much about the earliest emigration to America\\r\\nfrom Stavanger. In Detroit, Valder and Östen Espeland separated from\\r\\nthe rest of the party and went to Adrian, Michigan. Thence they went a\\r\\nfew miles into the country in Lenawee County to visit a small Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement, whither Ingebrigt Larson Narvig had recently moved from\\r\\nMonroe County, where he had settled in 1833.[77] In the spring of\\r\\n1838 Valder left for La Salle County, Illinois. Here he lived until\\r\\n1853, when he moved to what is at present Newburg, Fillmore County,\\r\\nMinnesota, and became one of the earliest Norwegian pioneers in\\r\\nMinnesota. Östen Espeland and family remained at the home of Narvig a\\r\\nlittle longer than Valder, but then they also went to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [77] See above, page 101, for the circumstances of Narvig\\'s coming\\r\\n       to Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother passenger on _Enigheden_ was Christopher Danielson from\\r\\nAardal, in Lower Ryfylke. He was fifty-seven years old at the time of\\r\\nemigrating, settled in Mission Township, La Salle County, where his\\r\\nwife died a few years later. Danielson died of the cholera in 1849.\\r\\nHis son, Christopher Danielson (born in Norway), resides at Sheridan,\\r\\nIllinois. Thomas A. Thompson, born 1812 in Skjold Parish, Ryfylke,\\r\\nsettled in Norway, La Salle County, Illinois. In 1867 he removed to\\r\\nAdams County, Iowa, where he died in 1870. Lars Richolson and wife\\r\\nalso came in 1837, and settled near Ottawa in La Salle County. Lars\\r\\nRicholson, as, indeed, several of the pioneers of these years, soon\\r\\nbecame one of the substantial men of the community.[78] Ole Heier, who\\r\\nalso came in 1837, from Tin, Telemarken, located in La Salle County.\\r\\nHe had been an ardent Haugian, but became a Mormon in Illinois, and\\r\\nlater a Baptist. In 1868 he moved to Iowa, where he died in 1873. A\\r\\nson, A. Hayer, lives in Leland, Illinois. Finally there came that year\\r\\nEven Askvig with wife and children from Hjelmeland Parish in Ryfylke.\\r\\nSettling first in Indiana (Beaver Creek) they removed the next year to\\r\\nLa Salle County, Illinois. Late in the forties they settled in Texas\\r\\nand at last in 1852 the parents and a part of the family located in\\r\\nsouthwestern Iowa, where Even Askvig died in 1875 and his wife in 1881.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [78] Attorney Samuel Richolson, of Ottawa, who died in 1906, was a\\r\\n       son of Lars Richolson. He was born March twenty-fifth, 1841,\\r\\n       on the homestead bought by his father in 1837-38. He was for a\\r\\n       long time member of the firm, Boyle and Richolson, in Ottawa,\\r\\n       was mayor of Ottawa from 1871-1881, at one time attorney\\r\\n       for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad. His widow,\\r\\n       Marietta Richolson, and two children are still living.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Ansten Nattestad\\'s Return to Norway in 1838. The\\r\\n                 Year 1839. Immigration Assumes Larger\\r\\n                 Proportions. The Course of Settlement\\r\\n                               Changes._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal event in Norwegian immigration history for the year,\\r\\n1838, is Ansten Nattestad\\'s return to Norway. We have seen, above, page\\r\\n103, that Ole and Ansten Nattestad left the Beaver Creek settlement in\\r\\nthe spring of 1838. Ansten went to Norway, as it seems, for the express\\r\\npurpose of promoting emigration from Rollaug, Numedal, while Ole went\\r\\nout to explore new fields. Going north as far as the Wisconsin line\\r\\nhe stopped in what is now Clinton Township in Rock County. This place\\r\\nsuited his fancy and he decided to settle here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was July first.[79] He entered a claim of eighty acres and\\r\\nimmediately set to work erecting temporary quarters. For a year he\\r\\nlived alone, rarely coming in contact with a white man, and not seeing\\r\\nanything of his own countrymen during all that time. \"Eight Americans,\"\\r\\nhe says, \"had settled in the town before me, but these also lived\\r\\nin about as lonely and desolate a condition as I. I found the soil\\r\\nespecially fruitful and the melancholy uniformity of the prairie was\\r\\nrelieved here by intervening bits of woods. Flocks of deer and other\\r\\ngame were to be seen daily, and the uncanny howling of the prairie wolf\\r\\nconstantly disturbed my night rest, until the habit fortified my ears\\r\\nagainst disturbances of this kind.\" The following summer, Ole built a\\r\\ncabin in which he received, as we shall see below, the first group of\\r\\nimmigrants into that country in the early fall of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [79] According to Ole Nattestad\\'s letter in _Nordlyset_ for May\\r\\n       eighteenth, 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1838 brought a small contingent of emigrants from Voss.\\r\\nThey were Steffen K. Gilderhus, Knud Lydvo, Ole Lydvo and Lars\\r\\nGjerstad.[80] Gilderhus went to Cleveland, Ohio, being, I believe,\\r\\nthe first Norwegian to locate there; he remained there only one year,\\r\\nhowever, going to Chicago in 1839. We shall later find him among the\\r\\npioneers of Koshkonong, Dane County, Wisconsin. Knud and Ole Lydvo and\\r\\nLars Gjerstad went to La Salle County, Illinois, and thence to Shelby\\r\\nCounty, Missouri, where the restless Kleng Peerson had the year before\\r\\ngone in search of a new locality for a settlement in the southwest (see\\r\\nbelow).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [80] As brought out by Nils A. Lie of Deerfield, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore passing on to the emigration of 1839, it will be in order to\\r\\nspeak briefly of a small group of emigrants from Numedal in the year\\r\\n1838. The name of the leader was Ole Aasland, a wealthy farmer of\\r\\nFlesberg Parish. He sold out his farm and, taking with him his family\\r\\nand about twenty other persons, whose passage he paid for, he sailed\\r\\nfrom Tönsberg, via Gothenburg, and thence to New York. He then went\\r\\nto Orleans County, New York.[81] Here it seems he fell into the hands\\r\\nof speculators, who sold him six hundred acres of marsh land in Noble\\r\\nCounty, Indiana, for a very high price. He removed to that place soon\\r\\nafter, it seems, with most of those whom he had brought from Norway.\\r\\nSickness set in, brought on by the swampiness of the region, and\\r\\nmany of his party died. He thereupon (next year) abandoned the land,\\r\\ntaking with him the survivors. In the Kendall Settlement, Andrew J.\\r\\nStangeland bought the land of him for a nominal price.[82] Aasland, who\\r\\nchanged his name in this country to Orsland, lived on the so-called\\r\\nNorwegian Road in Kendall, till his death, about 1864. In Kendall, he\\r\\naccumulated considerable property. He left a wife and four children,\\r\\nCanute Orsland, and Harry B. Orsland (born 1828 in Kendall), the former\\r\\noccupying the old homestead as late as 1895, and Hallock Orsland living\\r\\nin Detroit, where a daughter is also living. Let us now turn to Ansten\\r\\nNattestad\\'s journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [81] The Kendall Settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [82] Aasland did not take anything for it, says Canute Orsland in\\r\\n       letter of 1895 to R. B. Anderson; letter is printed on page\\r\\n       265 of _First Chapter_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Nattestad\\'s own account he went back to Norway in the\\r\\nspring of 1838 via New Orleans and Liverpool. In Drammen he had printed\\r\\nhis brother\\'s journal, _En Dagbog_, and Rynning\\'s book was printed\\r\\nin Christiania. He speaks of the great interest that these pamphlets\\r\\naroused as well as that of his own return. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"The report of my return spread like wild fire throughout the\\r\\n  country, and an incredibly large number of people came to me to get\\r\\n  news from America. Many even travelled eighteen to twenty Norwegian\\r\\n  miles to speak with me. It was impossible to answer all the letters\\r\\n  that came with reference to conditions across the ocean. In the\\r\\n  spring of 1839 about one hundred persons stood ready to go with me\\r\\n  across the ocean. Among these were many farmers with families, all\\r\\n  except the children able to work and in their best years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were, moreover, a host of people from Telemarken and Numedal, who\\r\\ncould not accompany him, as there was no more room in the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime these people from Telemarken, not to be deterred long\\r\\nin their plans to go to the New World, immediately set about organizing\\r\\ntheir party and went to Skien to seek passage there. They were all\\r\\nfrom Tin and Hjertdal parishes in Upper Telemarken. The leaders of the\\r\\nparty were the Luraas family, which was represented by four heads of\\r\\nfamilies, in all about twenty persons of the total number of forty,\\r\\ncomposed almost exclusively of grown men and women. They embarked at\\r\\nSkien, May seventeenth, somewhat earlier than the party from Numedal\\r\\nand arrived in America before, hence it is to this group that we shall\\r\\nnow turn our attention, leaving for the time being Nattestad and his\\r\\nparty. The Luraas party was in all composed of eleven families,\\r\\nmost of them being from Tin Parish. We have already, under Causes of\\r\\nEmigration, spoken briefly of John Luraas, who perhaps was the chief\\r\\npromoter of this emigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party consisted of John Nelson Luraas, Knut Nelson Luraas,\\r\\nHalvor Östenson Luraas, Torger Östenson Luraas, Halvor T. Lönflok,\\r\\nHalvor Nelson Lohner, Helge Mathieson, Ole Hellikson Kroken, Östen\\r\\nMöllerflaten, Ole Kjonaas, Nils Johnson Kaasa, and the latter\\'s\\r\\nbrother, Gjermund Johnson Kaasa, all of whom had families, besides\\r\\nthree unmarried men, namely, Nils, Ole and John Tollefsjord. The\\r\\nKaasa brothers were from Hiterdal; the rest I believe were all from\\r\\nTin Parish. In Gothenburg they met another small company of Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants, who had just arrived there from Stavanger, bound for\\r\\nAmerica. This party included Gitle Danielson, the leader of the party,\\r\\nfrom the island of Rennesö, a little north of Stavanger, and who had\\r\\na large family, Halvor Jellarviken, with family, and Peder Rosöino,\\r\\nboth with families, Erik Svinalie and sister; the party also included\\r\\nJohn Evenson Molee from Tin in Telemarken, who was at that time in the\\r\\nservice of Gitle Danielson. In all there were now about sixty. The\\r\\njourney across the Atlantic took nine weeks and the journey from Boston\\r\\nto Milwaukee took another three weeks. The latter led by way of New\\r\\nYork and then by canal boats, pulled by horses, to Buffalo; thence by\\r\\nway of the Great Lakes to Milwaukee, the most common westward route\\r\\nfor the early immigrants. This was at the close of August. It was the\\r\\nintention of the emigrants to settle in La Salle County, Illinois; but\\r\\nin Milwaukee they were induced to remain in Wisconsin, and a site for a\\r\\nsettlement was selected near Lake Muskego in the southeastern part of\\r\\nWaukesha County, about twenty miles southwest from Milwaukee.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story is told how it came about that they did not go to Illinois\\r\\nas originally intended. A good-natured fat man is said to have been\\r\\npointed out to them as the product of Wisconsin. On the other hand\\r\\nIllinois was described as a hot and unhealthy region in substantiation\\r\\nof which a pale, sickly man was presented as the result of life in that\\r\\nstate. Whether this was done or not I do not know; but the story may\\r\\nserve as an illustration of frontier humor and immigrant credulity both.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffice it to say that the people of Milwaukee succeeded in diverting\\r\\nthe immigrants from Telemarken from going any farther, but selected a\\r\\nsite for a settlement, as we have said, near Lake Muskego in Waukesha\\r\\nCounty. Then they returned to Milwaukee to perfect their purchase\\r\\nof land there, the price paid being the usual one of a dollar and\\r\\ntwenty-five cents per acre.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore reciting further the fortunes of this group of immigrants, the\\r\\nfirst to enter the State of Wisconsin, let us turn for a moment to a\\r\\nconsideration of the larger movement. With the year 1839, emigration\\r\\nfrom Norway begins to assume larger proportions, and certain districts,\\r\\nwhich hitherto had sent very few, now begin to contribute the larger\\r\\nshare of the number of emigrants to America. This year may very\\r\\nproperly be said to have inaugurated the second period in Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration history. Down to 1839 the immigration movement in Norway\\r\\nhad not really gone beyond the provinces of Stavanger and South\\r\\nBergenhus in southwestern and western Norway. Indeed, nearly all of\\r\\nthe emigrants had come from these sections. In fact, before 1836 the\\r\\nmovement was almost confined to Stavanger and Ryfylke. In that year\\r\\nit reaches Hardanger, and in 1837, Bergen. It does not reach Voss\\r\\nproperly before 1838, although Nils Röthe and wife had emigrated from\\r\\nthere in 1836. In 1837, as we have seen, the first emigrant ship, the\\r\\n_Aegir_, left Bergen with eighty-four passengers. Before 1839 we meet\\r\\nwith occasional individual emigration from provinces to the east and\\r\\nnortheast. Thus Ole Rynning and Snaasen in Trondhjem Diocese emigrated\\r\\nin the _Aegir_ in 1837. The first emigrants from Telemarken also came\\r\\nin 1837. As we have seen above, 1837 is also the year which records\\r\\nthe first immigration from Numedal. Among the emigrants from other\\r\\nparts of Norway prior to 1837 must be mentioned also Johan Nordboe,\\r\\nfrom Ringebo in Guldbrandsdalen, who came in 1832 and resided for some\\r\\ntime in Kendall, New York, later going to Texas, and Hans Barlien from\\r\\nTrondhjem County, who came to La Salle County in 1837. Neither of these\\r\\ntwo men, however, were instrumental in bringing about any emigration\\r\\nmovement in Gudbrandsdalen and Trondhjem. It is not until a much later\\r\\nperiod that these two districts are represented in considerable numbers\\r\\namong emigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the year 1839 in which emigration on a larger scale takes its\\r\\nbeginnings. Similarly, the year 1839 marks a change also in the\\r\\nmovement of the course of settlement. Down to this time all emigration\\r\\nfrom Norway stands in direct relation to the movement which began in\\r\\nStavanger in 1825, and which in the years 1834-36 resulted in the\\r\\nformation of the Fox River Settlement in La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\nThis settlement then became the center of dispersion for what may be\\r\\ncalled the southern line of settlements. All through the forties and\\r\\nthe fifties the southern course of migration westward, which includes\\r\\nsouthern and central Iowa, stands in direct relation to early Norwegian\\r\\ncolonization in New York and Illinois,--that is the first period\\r\\nof Norwegian emigration from the provinces of Stavanger and South\\r\\nBergenhus (and this province only as far north as Bergen, Voss being\\r\\nexcluded) in Southwestern Norway. In 1839 the first settlements are\\r\\nformed in Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Muskego in Waukesha County,\\r\\nand in Rock County; and in 1839-40 that of Koshkonong in Dane and\\r\\nJefferson Counties. These settlements then became a northern point\\r\\nof dispersion. From here we have a second northern line of settlement\\r\\nwestward and northwestward into Northern Iowa, Minnesota, and the more\\r\\nnortherly localities of Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Shelby County, Missouri. Ansten Nattestad\\'s Return\\r\\n                from Norway in 1839. The Founding of the\\r\\n                  Jefferson Prairie Settlement in Rock\\r\\n                          County, Wisconsin._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore returning now to the thread of our narrative, I wish to speak\\r\\nbriefly of an early effort, and the only one, before the fifties, to\\r\\nfound a settlement from the southern point of dispersion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1837 Kleng Peerson, Jacob and Knud Slogvig, Andrew Askeland, Andrew\\r\\nSimonson, Thorstein Thorson Rue, several of whom had families, and\\r\\nabout eight others, left La Salle County, went to Missouri and made\\r\\na settlement in Shelby County; this, however, proved unsuccessful,\\r\\nprincipally on account of the lack of a market.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeerson does not seem to have selected a very desirable locality, and\\r\\nhe did not possess the steadfastness of purpose that would seem to\\r\\nbe a prime requisite in the pioneer. He was too much of a lover of\\r\\nadventure, and hardly was a plan brought to completion before his head\\r\\nwas again full of new dreams and fancies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was something of a Peer Gynt but without Peer Gynt\\'s selfishness\\r\\nor his eye for the main chance; the roving spirit dominated Peerson\\r\\nwholly; not until old age had laid its hand on him did he yield to the\\r\\nmonotony of a settled life; but even then in the wilderness of Texas\\r\\nin the fifties. I have personal information of his life there; he took\\r\\nno part in the upbuilding of the community, no active interest in its\\r\\nprogress. In a settled community he alone was unsettled; he was never\\r\\nable to gather himself together into concentrated action and prolonged\\r\\neffort in a definite cause or undertaking. A vagabond citizen, he\\r\\ndied in poverty. The only activity we associate with his name is the\\r\\nadventurous wanderings of his youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having spent a year in Missouri Peerson returned to Norway,\\r\\nevidently for the purpose of recruiting his colony, but I have no\\r\\nevidence that he succeeded in this. Independent of Peerson\\'s efforts,\\r\\nthe little colony did receive an accession of three in 1838, namely,\\r\\nKnud and Ole Lydvo and Lars Gjerstad, and of one person in the fall of\\r\\n1839, namely, Nils Lydvo, who had just come from Voss, Norway, with a\\r\\ngroup of immigrants from that region, most of whom remained in Chicago.\\r\\nThe Shelby County settlement did not thrive. It was too far removed\\r\\nfrom other settlers, too far from a market; the settlers suffered want\\r\\nand became discouraged. The colony was practically broken up in 1840,\\r\\nwhen most of the settlers removed north into Iowa Territory into what\\r\\nis now Lee County. Here they established the first Norwegian settlement\\r\\nin Iowa. Of this we shall have occasion to speak under the year 1840.\\r\\nLet us now return to Ansten Nattestad and his party of emigrants, whom\\r\\nwe left above, page 119, as about to depart for America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad\\'s party of one hundred then sailed from Drammen by\\r\\nthe _Emelia_, Captain Ankerson, late in the spring of 1839. It was the\\r\\nfirst time, says he, that the people of Drammen had seen an emigrant\\r\\nship. Every person paid thirty-three dollars and a half (specie); they\\r\\nwere nine weeks on the ocean, going direct to New York. They took the\\r\\nusual route inland and arrived in Milwaukee just at the time when\\r\\nthe Luraas party had returned to Milwaukee to purchase land already\\r\\nselected in Waukesha County, as we have seen above. They urged the\\r\\nnew arrivals to stop in Milwaukee and go with them to Muskego, but\\r\\nNattestad objected, and so they continued their journey to Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Ansten learned that his brother had located in Wisconsin the year\\r\\nbefore. The party\\'s destination was La Salle County, but this changed\\r\\nthe course of some of them. Some who had friends there did go to La\\r\\nSalle County, a few remained in Chicago, especially single men, but\\r\\nthe majority went with Ansten to Clinton. All these (excepting some\\r\\nto be noted below) bought land and began the life of pioneers there\\r\\nin the fall of 1839 on what came to be known as Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\nBesides Ole Knudson Nattestad and his brother Ansten, those who\\r\\nfounded this settlement were: Halvor Pederson Haugen, Hans Gjermundson\\r\\nHaugen, Thore Helgeson Kirkejord, Torsten Helgeson Kirkejord, Jens\\r\\nGudbrandson Myhra, Gudbrand, Myhra, Erik Skavlem, the brothers Kittil\\r\\nand Kristoffer Nyhus, and T. Nelson. Halvor Haugen did not come with\\r\\nthe Nattestad party, although he was in Drammen intending to sail on\\r\\nthe _Emelia_. Owing to lack of room about thirty persons, including\\r\\nchildren, had to be left behind. Halvor Haugen has himself told (in\\r\\n_Amerika_, September, 1907) of the coming of these. After several\\r\\ndays of waiting, they secured passage on a boat bound for Gothenburg,\\r\\nSweden. The journey went via Fredrikshald, where another stay of two\\r\\nor three days took place. At Gothenburg a wait of ten days followed\\r\\nbefore the brig _Bunyan_, on which they were to sail, was ready. \"It\\r\\nwas certainly fortunate,\" says our narrator, \"that people were not in\\r\\nsuch haste then, or the repeated delays of several days duration would\\r\\nhave been the cause of much unpleasant irritation.\" Landing in Boston,\\r\\nthe immigrants travelled by rail to Providence, Rhode Island, thence by\\r\\nsteamboat to New York. Here they boarded the boat which was to carry\\r\\nthem to Albany. As they were told the boat was not to leave before\\r\\nfive o\\'clock in the afternoon most of the men of the party went ashore\\r\\nagain to purchase food. When they returned however the boat had sailed\\r\\nhaving left at ten in the forenoon instead of five in the afternoon as\\r\\nplanned. Those left behind managed to reach their destination also,\\r\\nthough with many difficulties and unpleasant experiences. From Albany\\r\\nthey travelled by canal to Buffalo. \"Of this part of the journey,\"\\r\\nsays Haugen, \"there is nothing to be said except that, like all other\\r\\nearthly things, this also at last came to an end.\" From Buffalo the\\r\\njourney went by steamboat to Chicago. They did not go thence to La\\r\\nSalle County though undoubtedly intended originally to do so. I do not\\r\\nknow what changed their course, but on the next day after arriving in\\r\\nChicago, they went to Du Page County, Illinois, where a week later they\\r\\nmet those who had gone with Nattestad in Captain Ankerson\\'s ship. The\\r\\nparty whose coming has thus briefly been related was composed of Halvor\\r\\nHaugen, wife, three sons, Peder, Halvor and Andreas, and two daughters\\r\\nBergit and Sigrid; Halvor Stordok, Lars Haugerud, Gunder Fingalpladsen,\\r\\nEngebret Sæter, Lars Dalen, Gjermund Johnson, and Sven Tufte, all of\\r\\nwhom also had families, besides some single persons. Halvor Haugen\\'s\\r\\nfamily and most of the party remained in Du Page County for a time,\\r\\nand Peder Haugen and his brother Andreas and the two sisters secured\\r\\nemployment there. The father, however, went with Erik Skavlem to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie to help him build a house. At Christmas the rest of\\r\\nthe party also went to Jefferson Prairie. During the winter they all\\r\\nlived in Skavlem\\'s house. This house is described as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"It was sixteen by sixteen and quite low. In order to add to room\\r\\n  \\'crowns\\' were erected overhead, that is, beams which were laid\\r\\n  crosswise near the ceiling. These beams were cut pointed at the\\r\\n  ends which were made to rest between the logs in the walls on\\r\\n  either side, like riders across the house. On top of these again\\r\\n  was laid flats, on which beds were arranged. Down below on the\\r\\n  floor there were also three beds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA writer in _Amerika_, March first, 1907, quotes one of the immigrants\\r\\nas speaking of the cramped quarters in the log cabin, in which the\\r\\nwhole party lived that fall and winter; room which to one family would\\r\\nseem too small now. \"How these settlers,\" he says, \"could manage in\\r\\none log cabin a whole winter is a riddle to me.\" The following spring\\r\\nHalvor Haugen also built a cabin which was always full as newcomers\\r\\nwere constantly arriving. At the same time other cabins were erected\\r\\nby Kittil and Kristoffer Nyhus, Gudbrand and Jens Myhra, and Torsten\\r\\nKirkejorden. Two years later all of these built new and more commodious\\r\\nhouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement thus founded exclusively by immigrants from the district\\r\\nof Numedal has always continued to be recruited largely from that\\r\\nregion (see, however, below). In the following year a few more families\\r\\ncame from Numedal, while from 1841 the accessions were considerable\\r\\nevery year for a number of years. Among these is to be mentioned Bergit\\r\\nNelson Kallerud, from Vægli, who also came in the ship _Emilia_,\\r\\nin 1839, but who does not seem to have gone directly to Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie. She married Jens Gudbrandson Myhra at Christmas, 1839, while\\r\\nhis brother, Gudbrand Myhra, married Ambjör Olson (also from Vægli)\\r\\nin 1840. The following year they, however, moved to the Rock Prairie\\r\\nSettlement (see below), and in 1852 they settled in Mitchell County,\\r\\nIowa. In connection with the settling of this county we shall have\\r\\noccasion to speak again more fully of them. Jens Myhra was born in\\r\\nVægli, Numedal, in 1812.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: Map of Southern and Central Norway\\r\\n                 See Appendix for names of parishes here numbered.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the other founders of this settlement I may here add the following\\r\\nfacts. Ole Knudson Nattestad was born at Vægli, in Rollaug Parish,\\r\\nDecember twenty-fourth, 1807. We have above given an account of his\\r\\nsettling at Clinton. In _Nordlyset_ for May eighteenth, 1848, there\\r\\nappeared a communication from Nattestad relative to this occasion, in\\r\\nwhich he rightly claims to have been the first Norwegian to settle\\r\\nin the state. He married there Lena Hiser in 1840; he lived in the\\r\\nsettlement, as an influential, respected member of the community, till\\r\\nhis death, which occurred at Clinton, May twenty-eighth, 1886. His wife\\r\\ndied in September, 1888. They left seven children; Henry Nattestad,\\r\\nthe oldest, at present occupies the homestead. The other children are,\\r\\nCharles (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), James (Dakota), Ann (Clinton),\\r\\nJulia (Mrs. Martin Scofftedt Lawrence, Kansas), Caroline (Mrs. Louis O.\\r\\nLarson, Clinton), and Eliza (Clinton). Ansten Nattestad was born August\\r\\ntwenty-sixth, 1813, the youngest of three brothers. Ole was the next\\r\\noldest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir father, Knud Nattestad, was a man of some means, but by the right\\r\\nof primogeniture, the oldest inherited the estate and he remained\\r\\nin Norway. Of these things and the early life of the two younger\\r\\nbrothers, Ole Nattestad gives an account in an interview printed in\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_, 1869, where also is a detailed account of Ansten\\r\\nNattestad\\'s coming to America with his group of one hundred immigrants\\r\\nin 1839. He also there, pages 107-108, gives a description of the\\r\\nsettlement as it was in 1869, and he has elsewhere in the columns of\\r\\nthat magazine made important contributions to the immigration history\\r\\nof the years 1838-1840, which now are among the original sources of\\r\\nmaterial for a history of Norwegian immigration. Relative to the\\r\\nfurther career of Ansten Nattestad I shall only add here that he became\\r\\none of the substantial members of this great and growing settlement, in\\r\\nwhich he continued to live until his death on April eighth, 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans G. Haugen was born at Vægli in Rollaug Parish in 1785. He was\\r\\nan old soldier, having been in the Norwegian-Swedish War of 1814,\\r\\nand having served in the Norwegian army for seven years. His wife,\\r\\nwhose maiden name was Sigrid Pedersdatter Valle, was born in January,\\r\\n1803. The family consisted further of two sons, Gunnul and Gjermund,\\r\\nthe former born at Vægli, April twenty-eighth, 1827, the latter on\\r\\nSeptember nineteenth, 1836. The father, Hans Haugen, lived only a year\\r\\nafter coming to America; he died in October, 1840. In 1849 the widow\\r\\nand two sons moved to Primrose, Dane County, Wisconsin, where we shall\\r\\nmeet with them again. Sigrid Haugen died in Beloit in 1885. It may be\\r\\nadded here that the family took the name of Jackson in this country. Of\\r\\nthe circumstances that led to the adoption of this name the son gives\\r\\nan account which appeared in Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, etc., page two\\r\\nhundred sixty-three.\\r\\n\\r\\nThore Helgeson Kirkejord[83] was born September twelfth, 1812;\\r\\nmarried in 1837. They had one daughter, Christie, born 1849, and\\r\\nwho is married to Gunder Larson.[84] Thore Helgeson died in Clinton\\r\\nin 1871. Christopher C. Nyhus (Newhouse) was born at Vægli in July,\\r\\n1812. When he came to Clinton Township he first entered claim to\\r\\nforty acres of land, which was later increased to a hundred sixty. He\\r\\nmarried a daughter of Halvor Halvorson in the fall of 1843. They had\\r\\nfive children, Christopher, who died in infancy, Oliver, Christopher\\r\\n2d, Torrena (Mrs. Gustav Nelson, Clinton), and Christiana. T. Nelson\\r\\nsettled on section twenty in 1839; he married Rachel Gilbertson that\\r\\nyear. They had five children. The son, T. T. Nelson, married Mary\\r\\nTangen of Manchester, Illinois, in 1872. They have two daughters, Anna\\r\\nR. (b. 1875), Gertine (b. 1878).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [83] Whose name appears as Torro Holgeson in _The History of Rock\\r\\n       County, Wisconsin_, 1879, p. 780, to which work I am indebted\\r\\n       for some of the facts recited above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [84] They again have four children. Mr. Larson enlisted in the 42d\\r\\n       Illinois Regiment, later transferred to the Mississippi Marine\\r\\n       Brigade, was at the battle of Vicksburg, served faithfully and\\r\\n       was honorably discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Earliest White Settlers on Rock and Jefferson\\r\\n               Prairies. The Founding of the Rock Prairie\\r\\n               Settlement. The Earliest Settlers on Rock\\r\\n                                Prairie_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that when Ole Nattestad settled at Clinton on July first,\\r\\n1838, the country was a wilderness, he being the only white man there.\\r\\nHe speaks, however, of eight Americans living some distance from him,\\r\\nin similar condition. It was less than three years prior that the first\\r\\nwhite settlers had located in the county. On the eighteenth day of\\r\\nNovember, 1835, John Inman, of Lucerne County, Pennsylvania, Thomas\\r\\nHolmes, William Holmes, and Joshua Holmes, of Ohio, Milo Jones and\\r\\nGeorge Follmer, settled on the site of the present city of Janesville,\\r\\nopposite the \"big rock.\"[85] This was the first settlement in Rock\\r\\nCounty. Inman and William Jones had visited the locality and selected\\r\\nthis spot in July of that year. On this occasion they had camped on\\r\\nthe bluff on the Racine road. Our authority relates: \"From this point\\r\\nthey saw Rock Prairie stretching away in the distance to the east and\\r\\nsouth, till the verdant plain mingled with the blue of the horizon.\\r\\nThey saw before them an ocean of waving grass and blooming flowers, and\\r\\nrealized the idea of having found the real Canaan--the real paradise\\r\\nof the world.\" They returned to Milwaukee, having in their ten days\\'\\r\\nexploration of the Rock River Valley, found but one family, namely,\\r\\na Mr. McMillan, who resided where Waukesha now stands.[85] Somewhat\\r\\nlater in the year came Samuel St. John and his wife, the last being\\r\\nthe first white woman in the county. The next year there were several\\r\\nnew arrivals. On December seventh, 1836, townships one, two, three,\\r\\nand four north of ranges eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, of\\r\\nthe fourth principal meridian, afterwards the eastern sixteen of the\\r\\npresent twenty townships of Rock County,[86] were taken from Milwaukee\\r\\nCounty and constituted a separate county, called Rock. The county\\r\\ntook its name from the \"big rock\" on the north side of the river, now\\r\\nwithin the city limits of Janesville, and an ancient landmark among the\\r\\nIndians and the early traders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [85] _History of Rock County_, p. 335.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [86] Avon, Spring Valley, Magnolia and Union being added in 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these earliest settlements (1836-1837) were made near and along\\r\\nthe Rock River. In 1838 there were four hundred and eighty settled\\r\\nin this region chiefly, the centers of population being already then\\r\\nJanesville and Beloit. Next follow Johnstown, Lima, and Milton, in the\\r\\nnorthwestern part of the county, and Union. The region west of Beloit,\\r\\nNewark, Avon, Spring Valley, was still wholly unsettled in the summer\\r\\nof 1839. The Town of Bradford, the next north of Clinton, was first\\r\\nsettled by Erastus Dean, in 1836; there were very few before 1838.\\r\\nThe Town of Clinton, as originally organized (1842), comprised the\\r\\nterritory of the present town, the south half of Bradford, and portions\\r\\nof Turtle and La Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first actual settlement in the present township was made in May,\\r\\n1837, on the west side of Jefferson Prairie, by Stephen E. Downer and\\r\\nDaniel Tasker, and their wives, on the southeast side of the prairie.\\r\\nIn July, Oscar H. Pratt and Franklin Mitchell, from Joliet, Illinois,\\r\\nmade claims. These were the earliest. On the west side of the prairie\\r\\nsettlement was made in October, 1837, by H. L. Warner, Henry Tuttle,\\r\\nAlbert Tuttle, and Griswold Weaver. We recall that Ole Nattestad said\\r\\nthat when he came to Clinton on July first, 1838, there were eight\\r\\nAmericans living isolated at considerable distance from him. Nattestad\\r\\nlocated on section twenty. Here Christopher Nyhus also settled, while\\r\\nThore Helgeson settled on section twenty-nine. Who the eight settlers\\r\\nwere that Nattestad met, remains somewhat uncertain, but it does not\\r\\nseem unlikely that it was the four last mentioned, and some of the\\r\\nfirst explorers, who are named as Charles Tuttle, Dennis Mills, Milton\\r\\nS. Warner, and William S. Murrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Turtle, directly west of Clinton, was not organized\\r\\nuntil 1846. The first settlers were S. G. Colley, who located on\\r\\nsection thirty-two, in the spring of 1838, and Daniel D. Egery, who\\r\\ncame there about the same time, locating on section thirty-six (to\\r\\nBeloit, however, in 1837). Such were the beginnings of settlement east\\r\\nof Beloit prior to Nattestad\\'s coming, and it was still virtually\\r\\na wilderness when Ansten Nattestad\\'s party came at the close of\\r\\nSeptember, 1839. West of Beloit, in the Town of Newark, the Norwegians\\r\\nwere the first, while in Avon and Spring Valley they were among the\\r\\nearliest groups of settlers. It is the settlement of this region, and\\r\\nespecially the Town of Newark, to which we shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observed above that some of Ansten Nattestad\\'s party who came to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie in September, 1839, did not remain there. These\\r\\nwent fourteen miles farther west and established a settlement in the\\r\\nTownship of Newark, which had not been settled by white men before,\\r\\nwhile a few of the members of this latter party went south from there\\r\\neighteen miles, crossing the Illinois line, and located in the Township\\r\\nof Rock Run, in Stephenson County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founder of the Rock Prairie Settlement was Gullik Olson Gravdal, of\\r\\nVægli, Numedal; he emigrated from Norway with Ansten Nattestad in 1839.\\r\\nHe came directly to Jefferson Prairie, but did not remain there. With\\r\\nGisle Halland and Goe Bjöno he went west a distance to look over the\\r\\ncountry, with a view to settling elsewhere. Having arrived at Beloit,\\r\\nthey managed here to secure a map and from it got some idea of where\\r\\ngovernment land was to be had. Then they continued their journey along\\r\\nthe Madison road seven miles farther west. Finally, he came to a place\\r\\nwhich suited him, for he found, as he says, \"good spring water, as\\r\\nalso prairie and woodland in the right proportion.\" Together with Lars\\r\\nRöste, a single man from the Parish of Land, he then bought forty acres\\r\\nof land.[87] Gisle Halland bought land one mile farther east, while\\r\\nGoe Bjöno took a claim on a piece of land for Mrs. Gunhild Ödegaarden,\\r\\nthree miles south of the site selected by Gravdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [87] Röste later went back to Norway, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunhild Ödegaarden (who emigrated from Nore, annex parish in Numedal)\\r\\nwas a widow of considerable means, who had paid the passage of several\\r\\nother persons. Her family, among whom were grown sons and daughters,\\r\\nemigrated with her to America in the Nattestad party and came directly\\r\\nto Jefferson Prairie. Immediately after Bjöno\\'s purchase of land for\\r\\nher in Newark Township she, with family, moved out there and had a log\\r\\ncabin erected, this being the first dwelling built in that township.\\r\\nThis statement is based upon the authority of Gravdal himself, as\\r\\nprinted in an interview on page 162 of _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869. _The\\r\\nHistory of Rock County_ agrees in this statement that Mrs. Ödegaarden\\'s\\r\\nlog cabin, built in the fall of 1839, was the first house erected in\\r\\nthe Town of Newark. Gunhild Ödegaarden\\'s name appears regularly as Mrs.\\r\\nGunale (or Gunile). She is there mentioned several times, her family\\r\\nbeing extensively intermarried with the old pioneer families in the\\r\\nsettlement.[88] Gravdal completed the erection of a cabin late in the\\r\\nfall, and his family having been left on Jefferson Prairie, he brought\\r\\nthem to Rock Prairie in the latter part of November (_Billed-Magazin_,\\r\\n1869, page 162).[89]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [88] Thus Ole Gulack Gravdal, son of Gullik Gravdal, married Juri\\r\\n       Ödegaarden (given as Juri Gunale in _The Rock County History_)\\r\\n       in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [89] There can be no doubt as to the correctness of the facts\\r\\n       as here given. It has also been said that Lars Skavlem\\'s\\r\\n       house was the first to be erected, and J. W. C. Dietrichson\\r\\n       erroneously even names him as the first Norwegian in Rock\\r\\n       Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same fall Gisle Halland married Margit Knudsdatter Nösterud\\r\\nfrom Rallaug Parish, Numedal, being obliged to go as far south as\\r\\nRockford, Illinois, to get the ceremony performed. Their oldest child,\\r\\nKristine, born in the fall of 1840, was the first white child born in\\r\\nthat township. Gravdal, speaking of those days, says: \"When I located\\r\\nin this region, the whole country to the west was a desert. I do not\\r\\nknow whether there lived white people anywhere between my home and the\\r\\nMississippi. The same was also the case toward the north; however,\\r\\nabout seven miles west (east?) from my home two Yankees had settled in\\r\\nthe wilderness. The Indians were still lords of these regions. They\\r\\noften visited us in our houses, but they were always friendly and\\r\\ncourteous. We were never molested by the wild son of the desert. There\\r\\nwas at this time an abundance of game; we saw stags in large herds,\\r\\nand prairie chickens literally swarmed.\" There seem to have been no\\r\\nfresh accessions of settlers until the spring of 1841. Then Lars H.\\r\\nSkavlem arrived and located on section eleven. Gullik Knudson Laugen\\r\\nalso came at the same time, and not long after several Americans moved\\r\\nin. Both Skavlem and Knudson had come to America in 1839, having been\\r\\nmembers of Nattestad\\'s party. Skavlem had, in the interval, lived on\\r\\nJefferson Prairie. Gullik Knudson had remained in Chicago, as had also\\r\\nGunnul Stordok, securing work there,[90] as did also two girls from\\r\\nNumedal, to whom they were engaged in Norway. These two couples were\\r\\nmarried the following winter, and, having saved some money from their\\r\\nsmall earnings, they decided to buy a home somewhere in the Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement in Rock County. Knudson relates: \"I walked about several\\r\\ndays to find a location for a home, and at last came to a place on\\r\\nthe verge of a prairie, where a rushing spring of water poured out of\\r\\nthe ground. Here I decided to build and live, and I called the place\\r\\n_Springen_ (the spring). The land about was like a desert; barring the\\r\\nfour Norwegians who had come before me, there were no settlers. Toward\\r\\nthe west one had to travel twenty-two miles to find white people. It\\r\\nwas fortunate that there was an abundance of game, for what we secured\\r\\nby hunting was the sustenance on which we chiefly relied during the\\r\\nwinter.\" He tells how, with the first fall of snow, he and another[91]\\r\\nwalked on _skis_ to Beloit to buy flour, and how the tracks left in the\\r\\nsnow by the skis had aroused considerable wonder and speculation among\\r\\nthe Americans about there, who afterwards discovered the tracks, and\\r\\nthat it became the subject of extensive discussion as to what unknown\\r\\nmonster could have left such tracks. Beloit, he says, consisted then of\\r\\na mill, a hotel, two stores, and a few laborers\\' cottages.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [90] His wages were from six to ten dollars a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [91] Whom we now know to have been Hellik Glaim.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fact of his location near the big spring, \"Springen,\" as\\r\\nKnudson called it, he came to be called Gullik Springen; his sir name,\\r\\nLaugen, he no longer used, but wrote himself Gullik Knudson. Here\\r\\nby this spring, Knudson built a hut of shrubs, thatched with straw,\\r\\nin which they lived for three months while the log cabin was being\\r\\nbuilt.[92] The flat cover of a chest, brought from Norway, served for\\r\\na table, and the cooking was done on the ground. In December the log\\r\\ncabin was ready. Gunnul Stordok and wife, who did not come to Newark\\r\\nuntil September, lived with Knudson during the first winter, after\\r\\nwhich they removed to Illinois.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [92] This log cabin is still used as a chicken house on the old\\r\\n       Springen homestead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [93] _The Rock County History_ says of Stordok: \"He and his family\\r\\n       lived in a haystack for three months until they had completed\\r\\n       a log cabin\" (page 774). As we have seen, it was not a\\r\\n       haystack they lived in. Stordok\\'s family consisted, as yet,\\r\\n       only of himself and wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1841 a considerable number of Knudson\\'s acquaintances\\r\\nfrom Norway came; these found a temporary home with Knudson, sharing\\r\\nin his genuine pioneer hospitality. Among them were Halvor Skavlem\\r\\nand his wife, Berit, the daughter, Kari, and two sons, Ole and Paul\\r\\nSkavlem, the latter with wife and child, Bessie. Halvor Skavlem died\\r\\none week after their arrival. The son Paul bought land; Ole first,\\r\\nhowever, went to Mineral Point, in Dodge County, returning, however,\\r\\nlater; he settled near Orfordville. Another of this group was Halvor\\r\\nNilson Aas, who, with his family, settled near Gravdahl, in Newark\\r\\nTownship. Knut Kristensen also came in 1841 and located on section\\r\\neleven, erecting a log cabin there. Finally, Ole Halvorson Valle, who\\r\\nlater moved to Iowa, was among this number.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of those who had come to Jefferson Prairie in 1839 removed to\\r\\nRock Prairie in the summer of 1841. Thus, Hellik Glaim, Lars Skavlem,\\r\\nand the latter\\'s three brothers, Gullik, Gjermund, and Herbrand; these\\r\\nall moved there upon their father Halvor\\'s arrival from Norway that\\r\\nsummer. Hellik N. Brække and Nils Olson Vægli came directly from Norway\\r\\nin 1841. The last mentioned was from Vægli Annex to Rollaug Parish in\\r\\nNumedal. He was born at Vægli Parsonage and was therefore often called\\r\\nNils Prestegaard. He lived at Gravdal\\'s the first winter; the following\\r\\nsummer he, with two others, Paul Skavlem and Hellik Brække, bought a\\r\\nquarter section of land together in section thirty-two in Plymouth\\r\\nTownship. Nils Vægli was married in 1844 to Kari Skavlem, daughter\\r\\nof Halvor Skavlem; they went to Koshkonong, in Dane County, to be\\r\\nmarried by Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson, who had just come there from\\r\\nNorway. They were one of the first couples to be married by him. Hellik\\r\\nBrække sold out his share in the land, and in 1852 moved to Mitchell\\r\\nCounty, Iowa. Lars Skavlem bought land and settled near Halvor Aas,\\r\\nwhose daughter (Groe Nelson) he married in 1844; hence, he was also\\r\\ncalled Lars Aas. He later bought his father-in-law\\'s farm, the place\\r\\nbeing called \"the Skavlen farm\" (Skavlenfarmen). Gullik Skavlem bought\\r\\nland three miles east of Gisle Halland in Beloit Township, about three\\r\\nmiles from Beloit; he, however, moved to Mitchell County, Iowa, in the\\r\\nfifties.[94] Hellik Glaim had stopped in Chicago till 1840, when he\\r\\ncame to Rock Prairie. Ten years later he sold out and moved to Fillmore\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [94] Of these various removals to Mitchell County, Iowa, I shall\\r\\n       speak more fully in the proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [95] Glaim located at Hanley Falls, Minnesota, in 1866.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is a brief record of the beginnings of the Rock Prairie\\r\\nSettlement. Of some of the founders of this settlement, which, in a few\\r\\nyears, became one of the most prosperous in the state, I may here add:\\r\\n\\r\\nGullik Gravdal, the nestor of the settlement, was born in Vægli,\\r\\nNumedal, in 1802; he died in 1873, leaving widow, a daughter, Sarah,\\r\\nand two sons, Ole and Tolle. Ole Gravdal was born in Norway in\\r\\n1830; he married Jöri Ödegaarden in 1855, after which he lived for\\r\\nthirteen years in Beloit, then removed to Newark Township. He is at\\r\\npresent living in Beloit, Wisconsin. Ole Gravdal dropped the latter\\r\\nname and used the patronymic Gulack. Tolle Gulack Gravdal was born\\r\\nin 1833. He married Bessie Skavlem, daughter of Paul H. Skavlem, in\\r\\n1857. They lived on the farm in Newark until 1894 (Tolle having lived\\r\\nthere fifty-five years), in which year they moved to Beloit. He died\\r\\nin September, 1903, leaving a widow and two children, a son, Gilbert\\r\\nGravdal, in Newark Township, and a daughter, Mrs. C. E. Inman, in\\r\\nBeloit. A son, Henry, died in 1902, and a daughter, Nellie (Mrs.\\r\\nW. O. Hanson), died in the summer of 1903. _Amerika_ for September\\r\\ntwenty-fifth, 1903, prints an obituary notice of Tolle Gravdal,\\r\\naccording to which his death was sudden, being stricken as he was\\r\\nat work. The notice says, \"he was one of those who had tried the\\r\\nprivations and the trials of pioneer life, and he was always ready\\r\\nto extend a helping hand to all who needed it. He enjoyed universal\\r\\nrespect and love for his sincerity and his integrity and his lovable\\r\\nnature.\" Sarah Gravdal, daughter of Gullik Gravdal, married Halvor\\r\\nHalvorson (son of Cleophas Halvorson), of Newark Township, in 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nHellik Nilson Brække married a sister of Reverend C. F. Clausen\\'s\\r\\nwife; in 1852 he joined the latter\\'s colony of settlers in Mitchell\\r\\nCounty, Iowa. Lars Skavlem was born in 1819. He married Groe Nilson\\r\\nAas in 1844; their children are Halvor, Bessie, Helen and Carolina.\\r\\nThe son, Halvor L. Skavlem, born 1848, is a farmer in Newark Township;\\r\\nhe married Cornelia Olmstead, in Plymouth, a granddaughter of Mrs.\\r\\nGunild Ödegaarden.[96] Gunnul Stordok moved to Rock Run (see below). It\\r\\nseems that he had retained some of his land in Newark, for when Gunder\\r\\nKnudson Springen (brother of Gullik Springen) came there in 1843, he\\r\\nbought land then owned by Gunnul Stordok.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [96] They have two children, Lulu and Lewis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now leave, for the present, the Rock Prairie Settlement, and\\r\\nobserve what was taking place elsewhere during the period that has been\\r\\nbriefly sketched here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n             _The Rock Run Settlement. Other Immigrants of\\r\\n                    1839. The Immigration of 1840._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been stated that a settlement was also established in Illinois\\r\\nabout twenty miles southwest of Rock Prairie, the same year as the\\r\\nlatter was settled, _i. e._, in 1839. This came to be known as the\\r\\nRock Run Settlement, from the name of the town. It lies partly in\\r\\nStephenson, partly in Winnebago County. The locality is prairie,\\r\\nrelieved here and there by bits of timber land. The foundation of this\\r\\nsettlement is also to be accredited to an immigrant from Numedal,\\r\\nwho came on the _Amelia_, in 1839. His name was Clemet Torstenson\\r\\nStabæk, and he came from Rollaug Parish. With him three others located\\r\\nthere in the fall of 1839, namely, Syvert Tollefson and Ole Anderson,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, and a Mr. Knudson, from Drammen. Stabæk was a man of\\r\\nconsiderable means. He selected land in Winnebago County, near the\\r\\npresent village of Davis. His son, Torsten K. O. Stabæk (born in\\r\\nNorway[97]) married Torgen Patterson, and they lived on the farm until\\r\\n1884, when they moved to Davis.[98] Kristopher Rostad and wife, Kristi,\\r\\nseem also to have moved to Rock Run before the close of 1839. In the\\r\\nfollowing summer came Gunnul Stordok, to whom we have referred under\\r\\nthe settling of Newark in Rock County. Stordok lived in Rock Run until\\r\\n1870; he then moved back to Newark, where the rest of his relatives\\r\\nwho had come to America had settled.[99] Gunnul Stordok was born in\\r\\nRollaug, Numedal, in the year 1800; he married Mary Larson (of Rollaug)\\r\\nbefore emigrating.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [97] Not on the homestead, as _History of Norwegians of Illinois_,\\r\\n       page 487, has it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [98] In 1895 he organized the Farmers Bank of Davis, Illinois, of\\r\\n       which his son, C. O. R. Stabeck, is now cashier.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [99] When he returned to Newark in 1870 he bought two hundred acres\\r\\n       of land, for which he paid seven thousand dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest arrivals in the settlement subsequently was Halvor\\r\\nAasen, born in Numedal in 1823, and who came to America in 1841. For\\r\\ntwo years after coming to this country he worked in the lead mines at\\r\\nMineral Point, Wisconsin, and at Galena, Illinois. In 1843 he married\\r\\nChristie Olson, and bought a farm in Laona Township, Winnebago County,\\r\\nwhither he and his wife moved in 1844. Here they lived until their\\r\\ndeath. She died in 1902, and he in March, 1905.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [100] Their children are Ole Anderson and Andrew Anderson at Davis,\\r\\n        Illinois, and Mrs. O. H. Lerud at Lyle, Minnesota; four\\r\\n        children are dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock Run Settlement was prosperous but did not grow to such\\r\\nproportions as its sister settlements to the north. In later years many\\r\\nof its earlier pioneers moved back to Rock County, as Stordok did,\\r\\nand as Lars Rostad and family also did in the sixties. Among those\\r\\nwho located at Rock Run in the forties were Hovel Paulson (born 1817)\\r\\nfrom North Land Parish, Norway, who located near Davis in 1846;[101]\\r\\nChristian Lunde, also from Land, Norway, came to Rock Run in 1848 and\\r\\nlater moved to Goodhue County, Minnesota; Narve Stabæk, Torsten Knudson\\r\\nand Nels Nelson, all three from Numedal; Gunder O. Halvorson, from\\r\\nKragerö; Svale Nilson, from Bukn Parish, Stavanger; Gunder Halvorson,\\r\\nfrom Telemarken, and Lars O. Anderson. There appears a very brief\\r\\naccount of the Rock Run Settlement by Lars O. Anderson in _Nordlyset_,\\r\\nunder date of June second, 1848. According to this there were at that\\r\\ntime twenty families, twelve unmarried men over twenty years of age,\\r\\nsix unmarried women of over twenty years, while there were thirty-two\\r\\npersons below the age of twenty. The whole settlement, he says, numbers\\r\\nninety persons and comprises 4,062 acres of land.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [101] He moved to the Old People\\'s Home in Stoughton in 1903, where\\r\\n        he died in 1907, his wife having died in 1905. His only son\\r\\n        was killed in the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have followed somewhat fully the immigration movement in Numedal\\r\\nand Telemarken in 1839, and we have also noted the fact that that year\\r\\nrecords its contingent of emigrants also from Stavanger Province.\\r\\nIt remains here to note briefly the growth of the movement in Voss\\r\\nand its spread elsewhere. Nils Lydvo came from Voss in 1839, and\\r\\nwent directly to his brothers, Knud and Ole Lydvo, in Shelby County,\\r\\nMissouri. At the same time came Anders Finno, Lars Davidson Rekve, Nils\\r\\nSeverson Gilderhus, and Anfin Leidal; their destination was La Salle\\r\\nCounty.[102] The party further contained Ole K. Gilderhus, Lars Ygre,\\r\\nAnders Flage, Lars Dugstad, Knud Gjöstein, Anders Nilson Brække and\\r\\nwife, Knud Brække and wife, Magne B. Bystölen, Anna Gilderhus, and Anna\\r\\nBakketun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis party seems to have arrived in New York early in July, 1839, and\\r\\nto have intended to go to Illinois. We shall meet with most of them\\r\\nlater as pioneers in Wisconsin settlements, but for a time many of them\\r\\nremained in Chicago, so that in the fall of 1839 and the following\\r\\nwinter there was a considerable colony of Norwegian immigrants located\\r\\nin Chicago. Nils A. Lie, of Deerfield, Wisconsin, writing of this\\r\\nfact, says there were more Vossings in Chicago about 1840 than all\\r\\nother Norwegians combined.[103] Among those who remained temporarily\\r\\nin Chicago were Ole K. Gilderhus, Lars Ygre and Lars Rekve. The last\\r\\nof these worked for a year on a steamer plying between Chicago and St.\\r\\nJoseph, Michigan.[104] I shall give a brief sketch of him below, under\\r\\n_Koshkonong_. Anders Finno went to Koshkonong, Dane County, in 1840,\\r\\nbut later settled in Blue Mounds, in the same county. In 1850 he went\\r\\nto California with a group of gold seekers and has not since been heard\\r\\nfrom by his compatriots.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [102] Where, however, they did not remain, as we shall see.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [103] _Bygdejaevning_, page 43.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [104] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 330.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnders Nilson Brække[105] was born at Brække, Voss, Norway, February\\r\\ntwelfth, 1818; he had married Inger Nelson in Norway. Brække located\\r\\npermanently in Chicago, working at first for Mathew Laflin and John\\r\\nWright. He laid the foundation of his future fortune in 1845, when he\\r\\npurchased some property on Superior Street, on part of which he built\\r\\nthe residence, where he lived until his death in 1887. He held many\\r\\noffices of public trust in the discharge of which he was able and\\r\\nunimpeachable in his honesty. Brække\\'s first wife died early leaving\\r\\nthree children.[106] In 1849 he married Mrs. Julia K. Williams; three\\r\\nchildren by this marriage are living.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [105] Andrew Nelson Brekke.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [106] They are all dead long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [107] A daughter of theirs is Mrs. J. A. Waite of the Anchor Line\\r\\n        Steamship Company. I am indebted to Strand\\'s _Norwegians\\r\\n        in Illinois_ (page 215) for some of the facts of Brække\\'s\\r\\n        personal history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the party of emigrants from Voss in 1839 were also Arne Anderson\\r\\nVinje (born 1820) and wife Martha (Gulliksdatter Kindem). From Vinje we\\r\\nlearn that the ship, on which the twenty emigrants from Voss came that\\r\\nyear, left Norway April sixteenth and that they arrived at Chicago in\\r\\nSeptember. Vinje located first in Chicago; soon after arriving he built\\r\\na log house, in which he and his wife lived during the first winter.\\r\\nAnders Brække, it is said, assisted him in the erection of the log\\r\\nhouse. During the winter Vinje worked on a road that was being laid out\\r\\non the west side; for this work he received sixteen dollars a month.\\r\\nThe next July however Vinje together with Per Davidson Skjerveim (who\\r\\nhad just arrived from Voss, Norway) each with his team of oxen left for\\r\\nHamilton Diggings in La Fayette. Here each took a claim of government\\r\\nland; of this we shall speak more at length in the chapter on Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1840 emigration from Norway was rather limited. There\\r\\nhad been a considerable exodus in 1839 from Numedal and Telemarken. The\\r\\nlull in 1840 may be explained by the fact that intending emigrants in\\r\\nthose regions were waiting for favorable news from their relatives and\\r\\nfriends who had gone the preceding year. The settlers at Muskego, on\\r\\nJefferson and Rock Prairies and at Rock Run had barely gotten located\\r\\nwhen the winter set in. Communication was of course very slow, and\\r\\nspring and early summer was the sailing season of Norwegian emigrants\\r\\nin those days. The year 1840, however, brought its quota of arrivals\\r\\nfrom Voss,[108] namely Kund J. Hylle, Ole S. Gilderhus, Knut Rokne,\\r\\nMads Sanve, Baard Nyre, Brynjolf Ronve, Torstein Saue, wife, and son\\r\\nGulleik,[109] Klaus Grimestad and wife, Arne Urland and wife, and Lars\\r\\nT. Röthe; there were twenty in all in the party. All of these it is\\r\\nsaid settled in Chicago.[110] They all came in Captain Ankerson\\'s ship\\r\\n_Emelia_, the same ship which carried Nattestad\\'s party in 1839. They\\r\\nwere five months on this journey, arriving in Chicago in September. We\\r\\nshall later meet with some of these elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [108] As also from Drammen, see below, page 159.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [109] Father of Torger G. Thompson of Cambridge, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [110] I gather most of these names from Nils A. Lie\\'s account in\\r\\n        _Bygdejaevning_, pages 47-48.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other names from different parts of Norway are recorded among\\r\\nthe immigrants of 1839. We have observed above that Johan Nordboe of\\r\\nRingebo in Gudbrandsdalen had come to America in 1832. Though he wrote\\r\\nletters home it does not seem that he succeeded in promoting emigration\\r\\nfrom that section of Norway, except individually, and then not until\\r\\n1839. In that year his friend Lars Johanneson Holo of Ringsaker,\\r\\nHedemarken, together with three grown up sons came to America.[111]\\r\\nHolo did, however, not go to Dallas County, Texas, where Nordboe had\\r\\nsettled the year before, but he first located in Rochester, New York. A\\r\\nman by the name of Lauman from Faaberg in Gudbrandsdalen also came with\\r\\nhim and went to Rochester. He, however, went west a few years later,\\r\\nsettling in Lee County, Illinois. Holo remained in Rochester two years,\\r\\nhe and his sons being employed there on the canal. In 1841 they went to\\r\\nMuskego, where we shall find them in our next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [111] The route led by way of Havre and New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1839 we find one man from Sogn, the first to\\r\\nemigrate from that region to America. His name is Per I. Unde,[112] and\\r\\nhe came from Vik Parish in Outer Sogn. He lived in Chicago it seems,\\r\\nthe two first years he was in America. In 1841 his brother Ole Unde\\r\\narrived and the two went to La Fayette County; we shall speak of both\\r\\nof these men later. Among the immigrants of 1839 who did not go to\\r\\nMuskego I may here mention Knud Hellikson Roe and wife Anna and four\\r\\nchildren who came from Tin, Telemarken. They went to La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, where they lived till 1841; thence they removed to Racine\\r\\nCounty and in 1843 went to Dane County, Wisconsin (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [112] H. R. Holand writes of Per Unde in _Skandinaven_ for July\\r\\n        seventeenth, 1908, stating that he came in 1842. Unde\\'s\\r\\n        nephew, Jacob Unde of Sherry, Wisconsin, contributes in a\\r\\n        later issue of _Skandinaven_ some corrections, among them\\r\\n        that Per Unde came in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle H. Hanson and wife also from Tin, Telemarken, came in 1839. They\\r\\nsettled at Indian Creek, near where now stands the village of Leland,\\r\\nLa Salle County, Illinois. The first winter they lived in a dugout on\\r\\nthe same spot on the homestead where the residence now stands. Mrs.\\r\\nHanson died in 1842, Mr. Hanson died three years later. The children\\r\\nwere Ole, known as Ole H. Hanson, Alex, Betsey, Helen, and Levina.\\r\\nOle Hanson assumed charge of the homestead and lived there and near\\r\\nLeland till his death in December, 1904. In 1855 he married Isabella\\r\\nOsmundson, who died in 1873. They had six children, one of whom is C.\\r\\nF. Hanson,[113] State\\'s Attorney, of Morris, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [113] To whom I am indebted chiefly for the family history. Alex\\r\\n        Hanson lives at Ellsworth, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Settlement of Norway and Raymond Townships,\\r\\n                     Racine County.

It was in\\r\\nthe first place unhealthy and the settlers suffered much from malaria.\\r\\nFurthermore it was very heavily covered with timber and the soil which\\r\\nwas clay yielded but small returns for their labor. The settlers\\r\\ntherefore found it difficult enough to make a living.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as the next spring several moved farther south into Racine\\r\\nCounty, where the conditions were more favorable and where a thriving\\r\\nsettlement grew up in a few years. The old settlement ceased to become\\r\\nthe objective point of intending emigrants from Telemarken. After the\\r\\ncholera year 1849 most of those who survived moved away.[114] The\\r\\nsouthern extension of the settlement, which took its root at Wind Lake\\r\\nin Norway Township, later spread out so as to include the townships\\r\\nof Yorkville, Raymond and Waterford all in Racine County. The old\\r\\nname, \"Muskego,\" was retained as the designation of the new as well as\\r\\nthe old settlement, although the settlement in Racine County is now\\r\\noften referred to as \"Yorkville Prairie.\" It is the beginnings of this\\r\\nsettlement to which I shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [114] The editor of _Billed-Magazin_ writes, page eleven of volume\\r\\n        I, that at that time (1869) Kittil Lohner and his brother\\r\\n        Halvor Nilson Lohner, from Hjertdal, Telemarken, and the\\r\\n        family of Gisle Danielson, from Skjold, were still living in\\r\\n        the settlement. The rest were dead or had moved away. But\\r\\n        Knud J. Bæckhus, from Hjertdal, and Ole Kjonaas, from Bö, had\\r\\n        settled west of the colony in the town of Vernon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founders of the settlement at Wind Lake in the Town of Norway\\r\\nwere Sören Backe, son of Tolleff O. Backe a merchant of Drammen, and\\r\\nJohannes Johanneson. The latter was a clerk in the employ of Tollef\\r\\nBacke of Drammen, whom he latter deputed to accompany his son to\\r\\nAmerica. He was a man of about forty years of age, of strong character\\r\\nand moral principles. He had some knowledge of the English language,\\r\\nhaving once lived for a short time in England. Sören Backe was a young\\r\\nman, evidently of little promise, whom the father sent to America\\r\\nostensibly that his ambition might be kindled by American opportunities\\r\\nand by being placed upon his own responsibility. In company with them\\r\\ncame also a third man, of whom I shall speak again in a later chapter,\\r\\nnamely Elling Eielson Sunve from Voss, a lay preacher and the noted\\r\\nfounder of the \"Ellingian\" sect of the Lutheran Church. These three\\r\\nleft Drammen in the summer of 1839, and arrived in La Salle County in\\r\\nthe fall of that year. The forest land had all been taken and was now\\r\\noccupied by settlers, and Johannesen seems to have been suspicious of\\r\\nthe prairie, where land could still be had.\\r\\n\\r\\nA contributor to the _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869 says that the conditions\\r\\nof distress, the winter storms and the extreme cold on the prairies\\r\\nwere the things that influenced them to seek a locality for a\\r\\nsettlement elsewhere, and that they did not go north to Racine County\\r\\nuntil the spring of 1840. He says: \"Early the next spring they walked\\r\\nnorth and came as far as to Wind Lake, where there was then a single\\r\\nsettler, an Irishman. Here in the primeval forest, on the shores of the\\r\\nlittle lake they had found what their hearts desired; and they bought\\r\\nthe piece of ground which the Irishman was cultivating, and Backe chose\\r\\nthis place as his home.\" It is to be noted, however, that K. Langeland\\r\\nin _Nordmaendene i Amerika_ says that they remained in La Salle County\\r\\nonly a few weeks and went north to Wisconsin that same fall (page\\r\\nforty-three).[115] Langeland adds further, that they dug a cellar in an\\r\\nIndian mound in which they lived during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [115] Professor Anderson accepts unreservedly the authority of\\r\\n        _Billed-Magazin_ in the matter and decides for the date 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn touching upon these facts in my article on \"The Coming of the\\r\\nNorwegians to Iowa\"[116] I did not hesitate to accept this as correct,\\r\\nand I must now adhere to this view. My reason is that as early as the\\r\\nmiddle of the summer of 1840 a small group of emigrants were ready\\r\\nto leave for America with the view of settling at Wind Lake, having\\r\\nreceived letters from Backe and Johannesen, urging them to come there.\\r\\nHad these not located at Wind Lake before the spring of 1840 the time\\r\\nwould have been insufficient for the second party at Drammen to have\\r\\nnot only received word from America but also to have made all necessary\\r\\narrangements preparatory to emigrating. I assume then that it was about\\r\\nDecember 1839 that Backe and Johannesen located in Norway Township. I\\r\\nam inclined to think, however, that Elling Eielson remained in the Fox\\r\\nRiver Settlement during the winter, and that he came to Wind Lake in\\r\\nthe spring of 1840. During that spring and summer the brothers John,\\r\\nTorger, Halvor, and Knut Luraas, with their families, as also Gjermund\\r\\nJohnson Kaasa, located in Norway Township. Nelson Johnson Kaasa, who\\r\\nhad emigrated in the Luraas party in 1839, remained in Milwaukee for\\r\\nthree months and moved to the settlement in November, 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [116] In _The Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, 1905, page 360.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1837, who went to the ill-fated Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement in Iroquois County, Illinois, was Mons K. Aadland. We have\\r\\nalready observed that he was the last one to leave Beaver Creek. He\\r\\nwith family also came to Racine County in the summer of 1840. He\\r\\nhowever selected a locality on the prairie east of the Indian mound,\\r\\nbuying a farm of a hundred and sixty acres on section thirty in\\r\\nRaymond Township. This part of the settlement came to be known as North\\r\\nCape. The nucleus of the later extensive settlement had then assumed\\r\\nconsiderable proportions by the fall of 1840; but new accessions were\\r\\nsoon to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacke and Johannesen decided to write to friends in Norway and their\\r\\nletters were productive of results. In the summer of 1840 a party of\\r\\nabout thirty persons stood ready to emigrate to the settlement in\\r\\nWisconsin. The leader of these was Even Hanson Heg, the keeper of a\\r\\nhotel at Lier in Drammen, who sold out his property and with his wife\\r\\nand four children came with this party. Other members of the party\\r\\nwere: Johannes Evenson Skofstad, Syvert Ingebretson Narverud, Helge\\r\\nThomson, Ole Anderson, all from Drammen and all of whom had families,\\r\\nOle Hogenson and family from Eggedal, and Knut Aslakson Svalestuen from\\r\\nVinje, Telemarken. All these came to Wind Lake and located there in the\\r\\nautumn of 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nSören Backe seems to have been a man whose generosity was as remarkable\\r\\nas his lack of business ability. His father, a man of considerable\\r\\nwealth, had supplied his son generously with funds upon his departure\\r\\nfor America. Sören Backe evidently loaned money very liberally to\\r\\nthose of his countrymen who were in need, and there were many of these\\r\\nhere as in all pioneer communities. It is said that when his funds\\r\\nwere used up he made a journey to Norway for more money. With this he\\r\\npurchased land, which he let out on easy terms to new comers from\\r\\nNorway. It was Johannesen who had charge of these transactions in which\\r\\nit seems Even Heg was a partner with Backe. Johannesen is described as\\r\\na devout christian, a zealous adherent of the Haugian tendency, and in\\r\\nevery way a noble character. As we have seen, the settlement developed\\r\\nrapidly, and it continued to grow for many years. Backe and Johannesen\\r\\nthen joined partnership and started a store; for this purpose an\\r\\nIndian mound was excavated, the walls were sided with boards, and this\\r\\nstructure, which was partly underground, served as store, living room\\r\\nand kitchen combined. Their stock of goods was shipped from Milwaukee,\\r\\nitself then only a village of one or two stores, a hotel and half a\\r\\ndozen pioneer cabins. Backe and Johannesen continued their business\\r\\ntogether for about three years when Johannesen fell ill and died (in\\r\\n1845). That same year Backe returned to Norway and settled on his\\r\\nfather\\'s farm Valle, in Lier, near Drammen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Heg was a leading spirit in the settlement in Norway and\\r\\nsurrounding townships during his life-time. Much has been written\\r\\nabout him and I shall not here repeat the eulogies elsewhere voiced\\r\\nin his honor. After Johannesen\\'s death it was Heg upon whom the\\r\\nsettlers in the early days of the colony leaned for advice and it was\\r\\nEven Heg to whom every new arrival from Norway to the colony came for\\r\\nhelp and counsel. His hospitality and his resourcefulness in the aid\\r\\nof his compatriots was boundless. Heg\\'s barn, where large parties\\r\\nof immigrants were received every summer, and in which they were\\r\\npermitted freely to make their home during the first weeks after the\\r\\nlong and arduous journey, is famed throughout many an early settlement\\r\\nin Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. The log cabins of the settlers\\r\\nwere too small to afford the necessary quarters for the numbers that\\r\\ncontinuously flocked in, and the large barn was a boon for which they\\r\\nwere truly grateful. For a time Racine County became the objective\\r\\npoint of most of the immigrants from Norway, a distinction which\\r\\nhowever it was soon to share with the still more famous Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie in Dane County, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Elling Eielson I shall speak below, as also of Hans C. Heg, son\\r\\nof Even Heg, and of some of the other Racine County pioneers. I wish\\r\\nto add here a few words of Mons Aadland, who as we recall, came to\\r\\nAmerica in 1837, and located at North Cape in 1840. Aadland was born\\r\\nnear Bergen, Norway, in April, 1793, being thus forty-four years old\\r\\nwhen he emigrated. He was one of the few survivors of the Beaver Creek\\r\\nColony in Illinois. As we have seen, he is the founder of the North\\r\\nCape branch of the settlement. There he lived till his death in 1869,\\r\\nhis wife having died two years before. A settlers\\' history says of him:\\r\\n\"He was a man of generous spirit, as is shown by his liberal gifts,\\r\\nand one who took a commendable interest in public affairs.\" Ten years\\r\\nbefore his death he owned between five and six hundred acres of land\\r\\nwhich he then divided among his children. Thomas Adland and Knud Adland\\r\\nboth of Raymond Township are his sons, while a daughter, Martha, lives\\r\\nin Norway; the other children are dead.[117] Mons Aadland was a nephew\\r\\nof Nils P. Langeland whom we have spoken of above page 100.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [117] Mons Aadland had a sister Malinda, the wife of Anders\\r\\n        Nordvig, who came to America in the same ship as he. Anders\\r\\n        Nordvig died in Beaver Creek. His wife moved to the Fox River\\r\\n        Settlement, where she died, ninety years old, about 1892. I\\r\\n        have above written the name Adland as it came to be written\\r\\n        in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigration of 1841 was not extensive. Backe and Johannesen do not\\r\\nseem to have continued their propaganda of immigration; but the party\\r\\nwho came with Even Heg wrote home letters full of praise of the New\\r\\nWorld. But even in the face of such tempting exhortations the old world\\r\\nresident requires time for thought before he decides to bid farewell to\\r\\nthe home of his fathers and seek his fortune in a strange and distant\\r\\nland. I am not aware that anyone came from Drammen or Telemarken to\\r\\nRacine County in 1841.[118] Knut Roe and wife located in Racine County,\\r\\nhowever, in 1841, but they came from La Salle County, where they had\\r\\nsettled in 1839. In 1842 there were several arrivals. Thus Hermund\\r\\nNilson Tufte with wife Kari and three daughters came from Aal Parish in\\r\\nHallingdal. This was the first family to emigrate to America from that\\r\\nprovince.[119] In that year came also Aanund Halvorson Bjoin, wife and\\r\\nfamily from Tin, Telemarken, and John Jacobson; further, Halvor Larson\\r\\nLysenstöen (Modum) from Hadeland, Norway, the first immigrant from that\\r\\nregion, and Helge Sigurdson and wife Bergit Olsdatter, who however,\\r\\nremoved to Dane County in 1844.[120] John J. Dale from Norway, who\\r\\nhad come to America in 1837 and settled in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\ncame to Racine in 1842; his wife Anna had died in Illinois in 1839.\\r\\nAnother of the immigrants of 1839 came to Muskego in 1842, namely John\\r\\nEvenson Molee. He had lived in Milwaukee the preceding three years; I\\r\\nshall speak of him below. There were individual accessions to other\\r\\nsettlements in 1841-42, but they are few in number. With 1843 the\\r\\nimmigration movement receives a new impulse, but the discussion of that\\r\\nyear will better be postponed until we have recorded the founding of\\r\\nsome other important settlements in 1840-42.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [118] Nor any from other provinces, for Hermund Tufte who, in\\r\\n        Holand\\'s _De norske Settlementers Historie_, is said to have\\r\\n        come in 1841, did not come before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [119] See below under Rock Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [120] The _Biographical Review of Dane County, Wisconsin_, 1893,\\r\\n        page 239, gives 1842 as the year Seamon A. Seamonson came\\r\\n        from Skien, Norway, to Racine County, his wife and three\\r\\n        children coming the next year (see later chapter).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Establishment of the Koshkonong Settlement\\r\\n                      in Dane County, Wisconsin_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genesis of the settlement of Koshkonong Prairie[121] in Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, the most noted undoubtedly of all Norwegian\\r\\nsettlements in America, dates from 1840. The recital of this event,\\r\\nhowever, will take us back to the preceding year; for the first visit\\r\\nof Norwegians to Dane County, is, I believe, correctly recorded as\\r\\nhaving taken place in 1839. Before discussing the first coming of Norse\\r\\npioneers to Koshkonong I shall mention a few \"first settlers\" in Dane\\r\\nCounty, who preceded the Norwegians; to do this will help to give us\\r\\na better idea of the state of wilderness which they found there, and\\r\\nwhich they in a few years transformed into a settled and thriving\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [121] In reality a group of prairies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe townships in Dane County in which the Norwegians settled most\\r\\nextensively are found in three groups, viz.: in the southeastern, in\\r\\nthe northern and in the southwestern part of the county. The first\\r\\nof these comprises originally Albion, Christiana and Deerfield; from\\r\\nthis region the settlement soon grew into Dunkirk and Pleasant Spring,\\r\\nand from the latter north into Cottage Grove.[122] On the east it\\r\\nextends into Sumner and Oakland townships in Jefferson County. This\\r\\nsettlement came to be known as Koshkonong Prairie, though properly\\r\\nthe name applies only to the two first-named towns and adjacent\\r\\nportions of Pleasant Spring and Deerfield. The second settlement\\r\\nincludes the townships of Burke, eastern Westport, Vienna, Windsor,\\r\\nand northwestern and central Bristol. The western portion of this\\r\\nsettlement is generally known by the name of the Norway (or Norwegian)\\r\\nGrove Settlement, from the post-office of that name in Vienna Township\\r\\naround which it lies. In its northern extremity the settlement extends\\r\\ninto Columbia County, northeast into Spring Prairie and Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nand northwest past the village of Lodi. This whole region is in reality\\r\\na northern extension of the Koshkonong Settlement.[123] It is also from\\r\\nfour to eight years later in order of formation.[124] Our third group\\r\\nof townships comprises Primrose, Perry, Springdale, Blue Mound and that\\r\\npart of Verona Township which lies east of Blue Mound Creek.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [122] Later Norwegians settled also in Blooming Grove (west of\\r\\n        Cottage Grove) and in Rutland (west of Dunkirk), but they\\r\\n        always remained here a minority of the population. On the\\r\\n        north the settlement extends also into southeastern Sun\\r\\n        Prairie and southwestern Medina.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [123] But Spring Prairie was settled slightly earlier than Norway\\r\\n        Grove.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [124] The settlement enters the Town of Dane (northwestern part) on\\r\\n        the west.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [125] That is, excluding the southwestern part of the town and\\r\\n        sections 6, 7, and 18 along its western line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Town of Albion the Norwegians were the earliest settlers, for\\r\\nsome of them came as early as the spring of 1841, as we shall see\\r\\nbelow. The _History of Dane County_, 1880,[126] says, page 838, that\\r\\nFreeborn Sweet, from New York, was the first settler in the town; and\\r\\nyet on page 1189 we are told that he was \"one of the first settlers.\"\\r\\nAs he did not arrive until August of that year he clearly was not the\\r\\nfirst. The next earliest American settler seems to have been Samuel\\r\\nT. Stewart of Massachusetts, who located on section fourteen in the\\r\\nfall of 1841.[127] The first white settler in the Town of Christiana\\r\\nwas William M. Mayhew who came in 1837, and located on section\\r\\ntwenty-eight. The next arrivals were Norwegians (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [126] A work which, unfortunately, contains a great many errors.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [127] In the spring of 1842 Duty J. Green and Jesse Saunders came,\\r\\n        both from Alleghany County, New York; they settled near\\r\\n        Saunders\\' Creek, where Albion village now stands. Saunders\\r\\n        had lived one year in Rock County. In 1842 also, Samuel\\r\\n        Clarke of Yorkshire, England, son of James and Judith A.\\r\\n        Clarke, arrived, and located on Albion Prairie. John S.\\r\\n        Bullis, Giles Eggleston, Lorenzo Coon, and Barton Edwards,\\r\\n        came in 1842, C. R. Head in 1843, as also Adin Burdick, and\\r\\n        in 1844 Job Bunting, L. O. Humphrey, R. P. Humphrey, Henry\\r\\n        Job, Samuel Marsden, and James Wileman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first settler in Pleasant Spring seems to have been Abel Rasdall,\\r\\nwho located his cabin on the eastern shore of Lake Kegonsa, about half\\r\\na mile south of the inlet; the year of his arrival, however, cannot\\r\\nbe given definitely and I am not able to say with certainty whether\\r\\nhe preceded Knut H. Roe (see below) or not. In the Town of Deerfield\\r\\nthe first settlement was made by Norwegians in 1840; as we shall show\\r\\nbelow; however, Philip Kearney had erected a house on section eighteen\\r\\nin 1839; he remained the only American there for several years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first settlers in the Town of Rutland were Joseph Dejean, John\\r\\nPrentice and Dan Pond, who located in its southern part in 1842. John\\r\\nNelson Luraas may have been the first settler in Dunkirk; he came in\\r\\n1843, and was followed soon after by John Wheeler,[128] Chauncey Isham,\\r\\nand Mitchel Campbell. In the towns of Cottage Grove, Burke, Windsor,\\r\\nand Bristol, Americans preceded Norwegians by several years, as also in\\r\\nBlue Mounds, where Ebenezer Brigham located as early as 1828, or some\\r\\nsixteen years before that part of the county actually became settled.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [128] From whom Wheeler Prairie takes its name. I am inclined to\\r\\n        think that Wheeler preceded Luraas (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Township of Springdale was settled first in 1844, when John Harlow\\r\\nentered it, he remaining the only white man there for a year. A few\\r\\nAmericans came in 1845, then Americans and Norwegian immigrants in\\r\\n1846. An American settlement was effected by Thomas Lindsay and David\\r\\nRobertson in the Town of Bristol (section seven) two years before\\r\\nNorwegians came there, which was in 1847. The earliest settler,\\r\\nhowever, seems to be William G. Simons who entered in 1838. The first\\r\\nwhite settler in Perry Township was John Brown of Indiana, who came\\r\\ninto the town in 1846. A few other Americans (as B. K. Berry in 1847)\\r\\npreceded the Norwegians, whose coming dates from 1848. In the Town of\\r\\nPrimrose, Robert Spears and family were the first comers (1844); a few\\r\\nother Americans had also arrived there before Christian Hendrickson\\r\\nlocated in the town in 1846. We shall now turn to the events that\\r\\nled to the establishment of the extensive Norwegian settlement on\\r\\nKoshkonong Prairie in the southeastern part of the county.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that most of the immigrants from Voss, Norway, who came\\r\\nin 1839, located either in Chicago or in La Salle County, Illinois. It\\r\\nhas been observed also that not all of those who went to the Fox River\\r\\nregion located there permanently. The land here was now mostly taken,\\r\\nbesides our pioneers from Voss did not like the prairie; they were in\\r\\nsearch of a location where timber and water was near at hand. And so\\r\\nsome of them decided to try their fortune in Wisconsin, where they had\\r\\nheard there was plenty of forest land with many lakes and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur party from Voss had been in La Salle County only a few weeks, when\\r\\nthree of them decided to go and investigate for themselves. These three\\r\\nwere Nils Bolstad, Nils Gilderhus and Magne Bystölen. They engaged\\r\\nOdd J. Himle (who had emigrated from Voss in 1837), then living in\\r\\nIllinois, to accompany them as their guide and interpreter. Bystölen,\\r\\nbeing taken sick and thus prevented from going, gave instructions to\\r\\nthe rest to select land for him if the region was satisfactory to the\\r\\nrest. Bolstad, Gilderhus and Himle started on foot for Milwaukee, a\\r\\ndistance of a hundred and fifty miles. Having arrived there in safety,\\r\\nthey procured maps and whatever information they could with reference\\r\\nto the regions that were open to settlement in the interior of the\\r\\nstate. Then they walked west about eighty miles inspecting the land on\\r\\nthe way, and after two weeks reached the eastern part of Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spot where they stopped was about two miles east of the site of\\r\\nthe present village of Cambridge. Here a man by the name of Snell had\\r\\nshortly before established a tavern for trappers and frontiersmen;\\r\\nwith him our party of homeseekers put up, and from him they received\\r\\ninstructions as to the \"government markings\" of the sections and the\\r\\nstakes placed at the corner of sections and quarter sections, giving\\r\\nthe number of each.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a two days\\' rest they continued their tramp westward to\\r\\nKoshkonong[129] Prairie. Himle, Gilderhus and Bolstad inspected the\\r\\nwhole prairie from one end to the other, walking about for two days.\\r\\nThen they returned to Cambridge, finally deciding on a parcel of land\\r\\na little over two miles northwest of that place, lying on both sides\\r\\nof the boundary line between the towns of Christiana and Deerfield.\\r\\nHere Gilderhus and Bolstad selected forty acres each, and forty for\\r\\nBystölen. This locality was chosen because of its abundance of hardwood\\r\\ntimber, and besides there was plenty of hay on the marshes and fine\\r\\nfishing in Koshkonong Creek near by.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [129] The prairie takes its name from Koshkonong Creek (and\\r\\n        Koshkonong Lake).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [130] As Mr. Odland points out. Odland adds: \"They were all Vossings\\r\\n        and to emigrants from that celebrated district in Norway,\\r\\n        therefore, belongs the credit of founding the most important\\r\\n        Norwegian settlement in America.\" (Article in _Amerika_).\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus made their choice of land, Gilderhus, Bolstad, and Himle\\r\\nreturned to Illinois by way of Milwaukee, walking the whole distance;\\r\\nthey remained in La Salle County through the winter. Their account of\\r\\nthe land of promise which they had discovered, aroused much interest,\\r\\nand, as we shall see below, brought others in their train later. Early\\r\\nin the spring of 1840, Gilderhus and Bolstad, accompanied now by Magne\\r\\nBystölen and also Andrew Finno, started for Koshkonong, driving,\\r\\nthis time, in wagons drawn by oxen. They arrived there at the end of\\r\\nApril and immediately took possession of the land selected. The land\\r\\nthat had been chosen for Bystölen was inside the Christiana Township\\r\\nline, where Anders Finno also now located. Nils Gilderhus\\'s land\\r\\nlay within Deerfield Township; he was the first Norwegian to locate\\r\\nthere. He built a log cabin, which was the first house in the town.\\r\\nNils Gilderhus and, I believe, Nils Bolstad, soon after walked to\\r\\nMilwaukee and filed their claims at the government land office, Nils\\r\\nGilderhus being the first in the party to purchase land. The date of\\r\\nthe purchase is May sixth, 1840; the land is the south half of the\\r\\nsouthwest quarter of section thirty-five. Nils Bolstad entered on forty\\r\\nacres of section two in the Town of Christiana, and Magne Bystölen\\'s\\r\\nforty acres lay directly east of Bolstad\\'s in the same section.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [131] Their names are recorded in the land office as Nils Seaverson,\\r\\n        Nils Larson and Magany Buttelson.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first habitation was a hurriedly built log cabin; it was not\\r\\nplastered, and, as we can believe, proved inadequate as a protection\\r\\nagainst winter, which was already setting in. Here they experienced\\r\\nthe intensest suffering from cold,[132] until, the condition becoming\\r\\nintolerable, they dug out a cellar against an embankment, where they\\r\\nlived during the remainder of the cold season. In this \"dugout\" Nils\\r\\nGilderhus and Magne Bystölen continued to live another year, but Nils\\r\\nBolstad erected a log cabin in 1841, when he married Anna Vindeig, who\\r\\nwas the first white woman in the locality. Gilderhus erected a cabin in\\r\\nthe town of Deerfield near the Christiana line in 1842, but he sold out\\r\\nin 1843 to Gulleik Thompson Saue; for further facts about these men see\\r\\nbelow. Andrew Fenno and Odd Himle did not purchase land.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [132] Odland writes: when they had finished their work outside,\\r\\n        they were obliged to lie down on their beds and cover up with\\r\\n        robes in order not to freeze.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [133] Himle settled some years later at Norway Grove, Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now turn to the two other groups of settlers on Koshkonong in\\r\\n1840.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n             _The Settling of Koshkonong by Immigrants from\\r\\n                  Numedal and Stavanger in 1840. Other\\r\\n                       Accessions in 1841-1842._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants who came from Rollaug, Numedal, in 1839, was\\r\\nGunnul Olson Vindeig, though, as we have seen, he did not come in\\r\\nNattestad\\'s party. Through the illness of a child he was prevented\\r\\nfrom emigrating with Nattestad, as he had intended. Coming later in\\r\\nthe year, he went via Chicago, directly to Jefferson Prairie, where\\r\\nhe remained during the winter. In the early spring of 1840, about the\\r\\ntime our Vossings, spoken of above, are moving north to locate on their\\r\\nclaims, Vindeig built or bought a boat at Beloit, and this being ready,\\r\\nhe, with a companion, Gjermund Knudson Sunde, rowed north along the\\r\\nRock River, up Koshkonong Lake and Koshkonong Creek, into the Town of\\r\\nChristiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the journey should have been made in a boat up Rock River\\r\\nagainst the stream, may sound like a legend; why not have walked this\\r\\ncomparatively short distance (about forty miles), just as Gilderhus and\\r\\nparty had walked the much longer distance from La Salle County? The\\r\\nNorwegian pioneers were good walkers and seem to have loved walking.\\r\\nVindeig evidently did not. That he actually navigated up stream I\\r\\ntake, however, not to be merely a local or family legend, for it\\r\\nis vouched for by his subsequent neighbors and comes down to us on\\r\\ngood authority. I myself visited Ole Gunnulson, Vindeig\\'s son, who\\r\\nis still residing on the old homestead, last August (1908), and also\\r\\nreceived his confirmation of the route his father took in the spring\\r\\nof 1840. Lars Lier, a neighbor of Ole Gunnulson, is cited by Prof. R.\\r\\nB. Anderson as having been told by Gjermund Sunde himself, that they\\r\\nhad tied the boat a little below the Anikstad ford, where the Funkeli\\r\\nbridge was afterwards built. Evidence comes also from some of the\\r\\noldest pioneers of the locality, as Halvor Kravik and Jens P. Vehus.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunnul Vindeig and Sunde returned soon after to Beloit, as they had\\r\\ncome, by way of the Rock River. Thereupon Vindeig, with his wife,\\r\\nGuri, and two sisters, moved from Jefferson Prairie via Milton,\\r\\nto Koshkonong, driving in a covered wagon, and proceeded to take\\r\\npossession of the land he had selected. He soon had erected a cottage\\r\\nof one room, with an attic accessible by ladder.[134] The land which\\r\\nVindeig located on is the south half of the northwest quarter of\\r\\nsection thirty-four. There he lived until his untimely death by\\r\\naccident in October, 1846.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [134] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 338.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [135] He was killed by a loaded wagon tipping over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGjermund Sunde selected forty acres of land directly north of\\r\\nVindeig\\'s home, which he later, however, sold to Ole Lier. The land\\r\\nwhich Vindeig purchased was recorded in the land office at Milwaukee\\r\\non May twenty-second, 1840, just sixteen days after the purchase by\\r\\nGilderhus and Bolstad was recorded. There has been much discussion as\\r\\nto whether the Vossing party or Vindeig built the first house in the\\r\\nTown of Christiana. Our first group of settlers had selected their land\\r\\nthe fall before and came north in April, 1840. We have seen that the\\r\\nlarge log-cabin they constructed was hastily and poorly built. I assume\\r\\nthat either they all together, erected this immediately upon arriving\\r\\nand taking possession of their claims in 1840; or else, the hewing of\\r\\ntimber and the erecting of the cabin was begun by the two who remained,\\r\\nwhile Gilderhus and his companion went to Milwaukee to file their\\r\\nclaims. It might then have been built at the close of April, or more\\r\\nprobably, the beginning of May. Now Vindeig\\'s purchase was recorded\\r\\nMay twenty-second; but as he seems to have gone direct from Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie to Koshkonong, he evidently had built his cottage and shelter\\r\\nfor the family before he started for Milwaukee. There can, therefore,\\r\\nhave been very little difference in time between the two. Absolute\\r\\nproof of the priority of either, it is not possible to obtain, it seems\\r\\nto me, but I am inclined to think the cottage erected by Gilderhus,\\r\\nBolstad, and party, was the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now turn to our third group of settlers, most of them\\r\\nimmigrants from Stavanger, who were living in La Salle County. These\\r\\nfour men were Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Amund Anderson Hornefjeld,\\r\\nBjörn Anderson Kvelve, and Lars Olson Dugstad. The first of\\r\\nthese--Bjaaland--had come in the sloop in 1825; he is the only slooper\\r\\nwho came to Wisconsin, and the last of that party whom we shall meet in\\r\\nour excursion down through the years of immigration. The second of this\\r\\ngroup was also from the Province of Stavanger, being born on the Island\\r\\nof Moster in 1806. We have seen that he came to America in 1836, and\\r\\nthat he had settled in La Salle County, where he lived for four years.\\r\\nThe third member of the party, Björn Kvelve, we have also met with\\r\\namong the arrivals of 1836; he had been living mostly in Chicago and La\\r\\nSalle County. He had come from Vikedal Parish in Ryfylke. Three other\\r\\nmen, Erick Johanneson Savik, Lars Scheie, and Amund Anderson Rossaland,\\r\\nintimate friends of Kvelve, were of the party, but these did not settle\\r\\non Koshkonong.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1840, these seven men decided to go north in search\\r\\nof homesteads.[136] From Gilderhus and Bolstad they had received\\r\\ninformation of Koshkonong and they decided also to go there and inspect\\r\\nthe locality. About the middle of May, I take it, they started on\\r\\nfoot for Wisconsin. The way led by Shabbona Grove, in De Kalb County,\\r\\nthrough Rockford, Beloit, Janesville, and Milton. They crossed the\\r\\nRock River at Goodrich\\'s Ferry, now Newville, then pushed on until\\r\\nthey reached the southern line of Dane County, stopping in the Town\\r\\nof Albion, near Koshkonong Creek,[137] and about four miles north,\\r\\nslightly by east, of Lake Koshkonong. Here they found country that\\r\\nsuited them in every way. Björn Kvelve is said to have exclaimed: \"This\\r\\nis indeed the Land of Canaan!\" Here woods were plentiful, the soil was\\r\\nrich, a vigorous winding stream teeming with fish, ran near by, and not\\r\\nfar off there was a large lake.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [136] For these facts I acknowledge indebtedness chiefly to Prof.\\r\\n        R. B. Anderson, who is a son of Björn Anderson Kvelve; he\\r\\n        gives an account of the journey of these men on pages 347-354\\r\\n        of his book, and a sketch of his parents pages 155-165; see\\r\\n        also page 171, and 245.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [137] Then a little river; now it is almost dried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see that the Stavangerings, as the Vossings, looked for wood and\\r\\nwater; they did not realize the superior advantages of the prairie, and\\r\\nthat it would yield much quicker returns for their labor. And yet there\\r\\nwas good reason for their choice, and we shall find that quite often\\r\\nthe early Norwegian pioneers located in a woodland tract near a stream\\r\\nor a lake. It was undoubtedly an inducement to build near a wood, where\\r\\nthe timber for the usual log-cabin was near at hand, and it was highly\\r\\ndesirable to locate within access of that primary necessity of life,\\r\\nwater. In this region, then, our party selected land. Amund Hornefjeld\\r\\nchose the east half of the southeast quarter of section one,[138] and\\r\\nBjörn Kvelve, the west half of the same quarter section.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [138] So the description reads but the Amund Anderson homestead\\r\\n        is the east half of the northwest quarter, and the Kvelve\\r\\n        homestead is directly south.\\r\\n\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland chose eighty acres immediately north of Kvelve\\'s,\\r\\nconsequently in section two, while Lars Dugstad took the east\\r\\nhalf of the southwest quarter of section one. Having made these\\r\\nselections,[139] they walked to Milwaukee to file their claims and\\r\\nperfect their purchase.[140] This is recorded at the land office under\\r\\ndate of June twenty-second, 1840, just one month, therefore, after\\r\\nentry was made of Vindeig\\'s claim in section thirty-four in Christiana,\\r\\nthe next township and section north. Amund Rossaland selected a piece\\r\\nof land near that of Björn Kvelve, but he was later informed that it\\r\\nhad already been taken;[141] so Rossaland did not settle on Koshkonong,\\r\\nbut went to Jefferson Prairie, as did also Lars Scheie, thence again\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [139] Thorsten Bjaaland and Amund Hornefjeld built shanties on\\r\\n        their land before leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [140] Their names are given as: Omund Anderson, Birn Anderson, Lars\\r\\n        Olson, and Foster Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [141] It was soon after taken possession of by William Fulton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party then returned to La Salle County, Illinois, and did\\r\\nnot move to Albion Township and take possession of their land before\\r\\nthe spring of 1841. Erik Savik became ill upon their return to La\\r\\nSalle County when he was asked if he, too, didn\\'t wish to go along to\\r\\nMilwaukee and purchase land, he answered: \"I think I can get a bit of\\r\\nground here from Ole Middlepeint.\"[142] His prophecy proved true, for\\r\\nhe died there in June, 1840. Erik Johanneson Savik and wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nhad emigrated from Kvindherred in 1836, locating in Rochester, New\\r\\nYork. A son, John, was born to them there in December, 1836. The\\r\\nfollowing year they seem to have removed to La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\nTheir daughter, Anne Berthe, was born there in November, 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [142] That is, Ole O. Hetletveidt. This incident is related in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ in September, 1903; the words were: eg faar meg nok\\r\\n        ein Flæk Jord her hos han Ola Meddlepeint.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the spring, Kvelve and Bjaaland moved to Koshkonong with their\\r\\nfamilies, following the same route they had taken before. Bjaaland\\r\\ndrove a yoke of oxen, and Kvelve a yoke of black steers, which were\\r\\nnot yet broke, says Arnold A. Anderson, oldest son of Kvelve, and who\\r\\nwas in the party; both teams were hitched to a wagon owned by Kvelve.\\r\\nKvelve\\'s family consisted, at the time, of wife and four children, two\\r\\ndaughters having been born since the arrival in America in 1836.[143]\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland (born in 1795 in Haa Parish, about thirty [American]\\r\\nmiles south of Stavanger, Norway) was still unmarried when he came to\\r\\nDane County, as was also Lars Dugstad. The latter evidently came north\\r\\nfrom La Salle County about the same time as Kvelve and Bjaaland. Amund\\r\\nHornefjeld married Ingeborg Johnson, widow of Erik Savik, in La Salle\\r\\nCounty, in June, 1841, and he, with wife and her two children, came\\r\\nnorth to Albion a few weeks later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [143] Arnold Andrew Anderson was born in Norway in 1832. The second\\r\\n        son of Kvelve, Augustinus Meldahl Bruun, was born in 1834. A\\r\\n        daughter was born and died in Rochester, New York, where the\\r\\n        Kvelve family lived 1836-37. Elizabeth was born in La Salle\\r\\n        County, Illinois in 1837, and Cecelia in 1840. A daughter,\\r\\n        Martha, was born in Albion Township in the fall of 1841,\\r\\n        being, it seems, the first white child born in the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, therefore, just twelve persons who located in northeastern\\r\\nAlbion Township that spring. The Hornefjeld family moved directly\\r\\ninto the shanty Amund had built before leaving in 1840. Dugstad made\\r\\na dugout on the side of a hill near the creek, in which he continued\\r\\nto live till 1855, when he married and moved into a large log-house.\\r\\nBjörn Kvelve erected a log-house on his farm immediately upon arriving\\r\\nin 1841, the logs having been cut by men engaged to do so, during\\r\\nthe winter of 1840-41. These men were Lars Kvendalen and Knut Olson\\r\\nVindeig. We shall now pass to the account of their arrival, and that of\\r\\nothers who came in 1840-41.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _New Accessions to the Koshkonong Settlement in\\r\\n           1840-1841. The Growth of the Settlement in 1842._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first explorers of Koshkonong from La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nin 1839, attracted others in their train from the same region the\\r\\nfollowing year, so Jefferson Prairie and Chicago sent new recruits\\r\\nfollowing Gunnul Vindeig in the summer of 1840. The first of these\\r\\nwere the two we have mentioned at the end of the preceding chapter,\\r\\nnamely, Lars Kvendalen and Knud Vindeig, a brother of Gunnul; both were\\r\\nsingle men. They came there early in the summer of 1840, and met in\\r\\nAlbion Township Björn Kvelve and Lars Dugstad before these had left for\\r\\nMilwaukee and Illinois in June, 1840. Knud Vindeig and Lars Kvendalen\\r\\n(the latter also from Numedal) came to America in the fall of 1839.\\r\\nAnother brother of Gunnul, namely Hellik Vindeig, and two sisters,\\r\\nBerit and Anna, came to America in the fall of 1840. As said, Kvelve\\r\\nmet Knud Vindeig and Kvendalen in Albion Township in the summer of\\r\\n1840, and he engaged them to split rails during the winter of 1840-41,\\r\\nso as to have them ready at hand when he should come there to locate\\r\\nwith his family in 1841.[144] These two men did not take land, but\\r\\nworked for a time for others in the settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [144] See above, page 179.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of the same year came Hellik Vindeig and Nils Kvendalen\\r\\n(generally called Nils Halling), but the latter did not remain there\\r\\nlong. The sister, Anna, married Nils Bolstad in 1841 (see above, page\\r\\n171). About a year later Berit married John G. Smith, a man who played\\r\\na role as both doctor and preacher among the pioneers in the forties.\\r\\nThere were no further additions to the southern part of the settlement\\r\\nin the fall of 1840, so far as I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the fall of that year Lars Davidson Rekve[145] came to\\r\\nKoshkonong and selected land in the Town of Deerfield. Entry of this\\r\\nwas made at Milwaukee on December eighth, 1840; the land was the\\r\\nsouth half of the southwest quarter of section twenty-eight, about a\\r\\nmile south of Deerfield, and two miles northwest of the eighty acres\\r\\nselected by Gilderhus in the spring. Together with Rekve came also\\r\\nOle K. Gilderhus, who had immigrated from Voss, Norway, in 1839. When\\r\\nthey reached Albion they stopped over night at the house of Thorsten\\r\\nBjaaland, who had not yet returned to Illinois for the winter. Then\\r\\nthey travelled north until they came to the place where the four\\r\\nsettlers from Voss had erected a log cabin the spring before. Not\\r\\nhaving the means wherewith to make improvements on his land, Rekve\\r\\nsoon after (summer 1841) went to Muskegon, Michigan, where he secured\\r\\nemployment in a sawmill. He did not settle in Dane County before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [145] L. D. Reque is still living in Deerfield, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf now we pass on to the year 1841, we shall find that there were\\r\\nseveral accessions to the Koshkonong settlement in that year. It is to\\r\\nbe observed, first, that a small group of immigrants came from Voss\\r\\nin 1841. They were: Anders Nilson Lie, with wife, Gunvor Sjursdatter\\r\\n(Gilderhus), and two children, Rasmus Grane, Ole Grane, Kolbein\\r\\nVestreim, Nils Vikje, Lars J. Mön, Knut Larson Böe, and Anna Solheim.\\r\\nThese had emigrated with a small brig that carried iron to Boston;\\r\\nthence they went to Racine County, Wisconsin, and Koshkonong, by the\\r\\nusual route. John Haldorson Björgo, who had emigrated from Voss in\\r\\n1838, as we have seen, also came to Koshkonong in the spring of 1841,\\r\\nand Ole Severson Gilderhus[146] came a short time after. The latter\\r\\nhad emigrated in 1840, having remained in Chicago during the winter.\\r\\nBjörgo settled in the Town of Christiana in section nine, Ole Gilderhus\\r\\na little farther north in Deerfield Township. \"None but Norwegians\\r\\nwere then living in these regions,\" writes Björgo twenty-seven years\\r\\nlater.[147] Björgo and Ole Gilderhus had, of course, arrived before\\r\\nAnders Nilson Lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [146] A brother of Nils Gilderhus.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [147] Interview printed in _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, page 387. Late\\r\\n        in the summer of 1841 a few Americans came and settled there.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first winter John Björgo lived in a small log-house;\\r\\nhis nearest white neighbor lived about three miles away. As he was\\r\\nunmarried he was obliged to cook and do all his own housework. Near by\\r\\nan Indian tribe had erected a camp, where they remained from that fall\\r\\nuntil the next spring. Björgo says of them that they were friendly and\\r\\nneighborly, and he never suffered inconvenience because of them; \"they\\r\\nwere often my guests, as I also visited them, and it never occurred to\\r\\nme to have any fear of the son of the desert. Nor did they ever give me\\r\\ncause for that; for they were peaceful and gladly shared their meagre\\r\\nsupplies with those who needed their help.\"[148]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [148] John Björgo died in October, 1868; his wife, Martha, died in\\r\\n        May, 1898. They are both buried in West Koshkonong Cemetery,\\r\\n        as Rev. G. G. Krostu of Utica, Wisconsin, informs me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now return to the party of eleven persons who came with Anders\\r\\nLie. The son, Nils A. Lie, Deerfield, Wisconsin, writes that after\\r\\na long and trying voyage they arrived in Boston whence they went to\\r\\nRacine, arriving there in December. There they hired two Swedes to take\\r\\nthem to Muskego, where the Lie family and one other family stopped with\\r\\nEven Heg. Lie\\'s destination was the home of his brother-in-law, Nils\\r\\nGilderhus, in Dane County. Leaving his family, he soon after set out on\\r\\nfoot for Koshkonong, not meeting anyone he could speak with before he\\r\\nreached Fort Atkinson. Here an American took him across the Rock River\\r\\nin a canoe, and by waiting there a day he was joined by two immigrants\\r\\nfrom Numedal,[149] who walked with him as far as Koshkonong. Thence he\\r\\ncontinued north to his brother-in-law\\'s place in Deerfield Township.\\r\\nWe have seen that Nils Gilderhus made a dugout early in the winter of\\r\\n1840-41, having found the cabin they had built in the spring too cold.\\r\\nIn this dugout Anders Lie and family[150] also lived during the winters\\r\\nof 1841-42 and 1842-43. In the meantime Anders Lie worked for others,\\r\\nsaving up all he could with a view to buying a home for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [149] These may have been Hellik Vindeig and Nils Kvendalen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [150] The family being sent for soon after; his wife, Gunvor\\r\\n        Sjursdatter, was born in 1805; the children were Martha (born\\r\\n        1838) and Nils (born 1841).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1843 he bought forty acres farther west in the northeast corner of\\r\\nthe town of Pleasant Spring, becoming the first Norwegian to settle in\\r\\nthat township; selling this out in the fall of 1844 to Peder Gjerde,\\r\\nhe located on section thirty-two in Deerfield Township, where he lived\\r\\nmost of the time till his death in 1907.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [151] After his wife\\'s death he lived some years in North and South\\r\\n        Dakota. Anders Lee was born in 1814, and attained therefore\\r\\n        to the good old age of ninety-two. His wife died in 1876;\\r\\n        they were married three years before leaving Norway. Anders\\r\\n        Lee left three sons, Nils A. in Deerfield, Sever Lee in\\r\\n        Grafton, N. D., and Andrew Lee of Washington County, N. D.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how long the rest of Anders Lee\\'s party remained in Muskego I\\r\\nam not able to say at this moment. Nils Lie writes in 1902 that they\\r\\nall came to Koshkonong, and I accept that as authoritative; but I\\r\\nmay add that the names of Grane, Vikje, Vestreim, Mön, or Böe, do\\r\\nnot appear in the roll of members of Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson\\'s\\r\\nchurch in Koshkonong for the years 1844 to 1850, which is elsewhere\\r\\npublished in this volume. Nor have I been able to trace them in the\\r\\ntowns of Christiana or Deerfield in the years 1842 to 1844. They do\\r\\nnot appear as purchasers of land, and probably left for other regions\\r\\nsoon after coming to Koshkonong. One member of the group who came from\\r\\nVoss in 1839, with Ole K. Gilderhus and others, did soon after come to\\r\\nKoshkonong, however, namely, Knut Brække. He and his wife located in\\r\\nDeerfield Township in 1843; it was he who, in 1844, bought the large\\r\\nlog-cabin built by Nils Gilderhus in 1840. He then removed it farther\\r\\nsoutheast (in the same town), where later it became the property of\\r\\nErik Lee, the father of Andrew E. Lee, of South Dakota.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [152] Andrew E. Lee was governor of South Dakota from 1896-1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also several accessions from Numedal in 1842. The first of\\r\\nthese, I believe, were Jens Pederson Vehus, from Nore Annex of Rollaug\\r\\nParish, Numedal, and Thore Knudson Nore and sons, Knut, Lars, Ole and\\r\\nSæbjörn, also from Nore.[153] With them came also Halvor Funkelien,\\r\\na native of Kongsberg. Jens Vehus was a brother of Gunnul Vindeig\\'s\\r\\nwife. All three of these came directly from Norway. Jens Vehus settled\\r\\nabout three-quarters of a mile southeast of Gunnul Vindeig, on the\\r\\nnorth half of the northeast quarter of section thirty-five. Later\\r\\nin the summer, and in the fall, this locality received new recruits\\r\\nfrom Numedal, who came for the most part directly from Norway via New\\r\\nYork, Milwaukee, and Muskego, to Koshkonong. Others came from Chicago,\\r\\nLa Salle County, and Jefferson Prairie, principally to the towns of\\r\\nChristiana and Deerfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [153] There Nore located across the Jefferson County line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants from Numedal who located there later in the year\\r\\nof 1842 were: Ole Helgeson Lien, wife Turi,[154] and children, Barbro\\r\\nand Ole, from Nore; Niels Olson Smetbak, wife Barbro Olsdatter, and\\r\\nfamily, from Nore; Mrs. Ole Bakli (Bagley), widow, and her son, Ole,\\r\\nfrom Flesberg; Björn Guldbrandsen Mörkvold, wife Asbjör and son,\\r\\nGuldbrand; Hellik Gunderson Hvashovd and wife, Marit, from Flesberg;\\r\\nHellik\\'s parents, Gunder Gunderson Hvashovd and wife, Kirsti; Mari\\r\\nGuldbrandsen (cousin of Gunnar Hvashovd) and her daughter, Kristi (born\\r\\nKristoffersen 1826); Herbrand Tollefson Mörkvold and son, Ole, and\\r\\ndaughter, Ragnild; Torstein Levorsen Bergrud, wife Kirsti Gundersdatter\\r\\n(born Hvashovd) and son, Levor, from Flesberg; Thore Olson Kaasa, wife\\r\\nAnne Torsteinsdatter, and daughter Aslau, from Rollaug; Ole Amundson\\r\\nBuind, wife Helene (Brandt), and daughter Anne, from Flesberg; Gjertrud\\r\\nOlsdatter Sælabakka (born 1822), from Rollaug; Juul Gisleson Hamre\\r\\n(born 1805), with wife Anne Gundersdatter, and children, Gisle,\\r\\nKjersti, and Gunder, and his sister, Anne Gislesdatter, from Flesberg\\r\\n(born 1797); Hellik Helliksen Foslieiet (born 1812), his wife Sigrid,\\r\\nand children, Hellik (born 1833), Anders (born 1835), Marit (born\\r\\n1838), Christoffer (born 1841).[155]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [154] Turi Lien, whose maiden name was Smetbak, was born in 1811;\\r\\n        she died in 1899; Ole Lien died in 1850; the widow then\\r\\n        married Lars T. Nore.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [155] The daughters Christine and Sigrid were born in 1842 and 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those mentioned here the Hvashovd, Hamre, and Bergrud families, Mari\\r\\nGulbrandsen and her daughter, Christi, and one or two more, nineteen in\\r\\nall, left Flesberg, Numedal, in May and arrived in Muskego in October.\\r\\nHere they stopped two or three weeks with Even Hegg, whose wife was a\\r\\nrelative of Mari Gulbrandsen. Some early settlers on Liberty Prairie\\r\\n(Koshkonong) took their baggage to Koshkonong while the immigrants\\r\\nwalked. These facts are told me by Reverend K. A. Kasberg of Spring\\r\\nGrove, Minnesota, as related by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Halvor Kravik,\\r\\nwho was in the party (she was Kristi Kristoffersen). She relates also\\r\\nthat \"in the spring (hence 1843) she and her mother walked to Madison\\r\\nto get work. There was only one house on the whole road, that of an\\r\\nAmerican family; but their friendly \\'come in, come in\\' (Norwegian _kom\\r\\nind, kom ind_, but pronounced alike) was easily understood. Here we\\r\\nwere well entertained over night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Telemarken the following came:[156] Richard Björnson Rotkjön\\r\\n(born 1816), and brother Aslak (born 1826), from Vinje; Torstein\\r\\nTorsteinson Gaarden, from Tin; Ole Höljeson Yttreböe, with wife,\\r\\nMargit, and children, Johanne and Anne, and Halvor Hansen Dalstiel\\r\\n(Dalastöl), from Hvideseid; Ole Torsteinson Aasnes, wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nand daughter, Hæge, from Vinje; Ole Gulliksen Barstad (born 1791),\\r\\nwife, Ingeborg Jonsdatter (born 1799), and children, Vetle, Eivind,\\r\\nand Halvor, from Siljord; Ole Olson Haugan, from Siljord; Torbjörn\\r\\nHavredalen, wife, Lisa, and family, from Vinje;[157] and Gunhild\\r\\nSaamundsdatter (born 1798), from Laurdal. Furthermore Guro Olsdatter\\r\\n(born 1821), from Nissedal, and Thomas Johnson Landeman (born 1804),\\r\\nfrom Sandsværd; and Torbjörn Havredalen with wife, Lisa, and family,\\r\\nalso came to Koshkonong that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [156] Many of these located in the eastern and northern part of the\\r\\n        settlement a year or two later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [157] Who located in Town of Deerfield. Some of these, as Dalstiel,\\r\\n        left Koshkonong a few years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great majority of these made the town of Christiana their first\\r\\nstopping place. So that, by the end of 1842, there were perhaps more\\r\\nimmigrants found together within the area of that township than in any\\r\\nof the other settlements founded during the preceding years, 1839-1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this time that the question of a name for the new town was\\r\\nbeing mooted. Gunnul Vindeig was given the privilege of naming it, and\\r\\nhe decided for Christiania, adopting the name of the capital of Norway.\\r\\nThe form as it came to stand, however, would seem to be a typical\\r\\ninstance of that slovenly habit of slurring syllables in foreign names,\\r\\nwhich so often appears in the records of American officials or clerks\\r\\nin land offices in those days. Yet the _Billed-Magazin_ is authority\\r\\nfor the statement that Gunnul Vindeig himself was the cause of the\\r\\nerror, he, by mistake, writing Christiana instead of the correct\\r\\nChristiania.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime new colonies are springing up elsewhere and the\\r\\nsettlements previously established are growing and thriving. Before,\\r\\ntherefore, tracing the further development on Koshkonong Prairie, it\\r\\nwill be in order to note the advance in other localities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The First Norwegian Settlement in Iowa, at Sugar\\r\\n                         Creek, in Lee County_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same year that records the genesis of the Koshkonong Settlement,\\r\\nalso registers the founding of the earliest Norwegian colony in Iowa,\\r\\nthat of Sugar Creek, in Lee County, in the southeastern part of the\\r\\nstate. When Kleng Peerson was on his way to Missouri in 1837 (see\\r\\nabove, page 117), it seems that he passed through the southeastern\\r\\ncorner of Iowa; he was, therefore, in all probability the first\\r\\nNorwegian to enter the State of Iowa.[158] Iowa had been organized\\r\\nas a territory in 1838. The settlers in Shelby County, Missouri,\\r\\nwere dissatisfied, and, having heard of the natural resources of\\r\\nthe Territory of Iowa, immediately to the north, and that good land\\r\\nwith a near market[159] could be had in the southeastern part of the\\r\\nterritory, they decided to move to Iowa. Going north into Lee County,\\r\\nIowa, they located at a place six miles northwest of Keokuk, known as\\r\\nSugar Creek. Andrew Simonsen and most of the settlers in Shelby County\\r\\ncame at that time; but Peerson remained in Missouri. Here, however,\\r\\nthey found a small colony of Norwegians who had, it seems, but recently\\r\\nestablished themselves. With the exception of one to be mentioned\\r\\nbelow, it is not known who these earlier settlers were, and I have not\\r\\nbeen able to ascertain where they came from.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [158] Though not the first Scandinavian, for a Dane, Niels\\r\\n        Christian Boye, came to Muscatine, Iowa, in 1837. In 1842\\r\\n        he located in Iowa City; a daughter, Julia Boye, the only\\r\\n        surviving member of the family, lives now in Iowa City.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [159] One of the settlers in Shelby County, Missouri, was Peter\\r\\n        Omundson Gjilje. As an illustration of the state of\\r\\n        wilderness of the country around them it is related that\\r\\n        Gjilje once walked for nine whole days in the forest tract\\r\\n        before he found human habitation. One morning early he heard\\r\\n        a cock crow, and then he found people. During these days he\\r\\n        had lived on wild strawberries. These facts are related by\\r\\n        Mr. B. L. Wick of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nKleng Peerson has been accredited with being the founder also of the\\r\\nSugar Creek Settlement, but there is no proof that he previously\\r\\nselected the site or even that he located there in 1840. Indeed the\\r\\nevidence goes rather to show that he never actually settled at Sugar\\r\\nCreek. His home in the following years was probably chiefly in Shelby\\r\\nCounty, Missouri; in 1847 he sold his land there and joined the\\r\\nSwedish colony in Henry County, Illinois, which had been founded in\\r\\n1846. Nor does it seem to me that Hans Barlien was a member of the\\r\\nMissouri colony, as Professor Anderson suggests. No mention of Barlien\\r\\ncan be found in connection with the Shelby County colony or any other\\r\\nsettlement. It seems more probable that he went to the Fox River\\r\\nSettlement when he came from Norway in 1837, but with a few others left\\r\\nin 1840, coming to Lee County somewhat before the party that came with\\r\\nAndrew Simonsen from Shelby County. They may originally have received\\r\\ntheir knowledge of this locality from Peerson. Barlien himself may have\\r\\nbeen in La Salle County when Peerson in 1837 returned from his journey\\r\\nto Missouri. It was, then, Barlien and a few immigrants with him whom\\r\\nAndrew Simonsen and others from Shelby County found already settled at\\r\\nSugar Creek in the spring of 1840. If this is correct then the first\\r\\nNorwegian settler in Iowa and the real founder of the first Norwegian\\r\\ncolony in the state is Hans Barlien, who was born at Overhalden in the\\r\\nprovince of Trondhjem about 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1838 Kleng Peerson went to Norway to gather recruits for the Shelby\\r\\nCounty colony; the following year he brought back with him from\\r\\nStavanger County the three brothers, Peter, William, and Hans Tesman,\\r\\nNils Olson, Ole Reierson and family, and six or seven women, all of\\r\\nwhom came to Missouri; but several of these went to Lee County, Iowa,\\r\\nthe following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as known, the first settlers who came with Andrew Simonsen from\\r\\nMissouri were: Omund Olson, Knud Slogvig,[160] Jacob O. Hetletvedt,\\r\\nMrs. Thorstein T. Rue and her sons, Thorstein and John, Peter Omundson\\r\\nGjilje, Erik Öie, Ole Öiesöen, and the three Tesman brothers; some of\\r\\nthe rest seem to have followed later. Lars Tallakson settled there\\r\\nabout the same time, but he came from Clark County, Missouri, where\\r\\nhe had located in 1838. Gjermund Helgeson[161] was also among the\\r\\nearliest settlers, and Jacob Slogvig, who had gone back to La Salle\\r\\nCounty in 1838, likewise later located at Sugar Creek. Among the\\r\\nsubsequent arrivals were Ole Soppeland, Hans William, C. Person, and\\r\\nNils and Christ Nelson; these located there before 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [160] Jacob Slogvig was also among the first settlers; he had\\r\\n        returned from Shelby County, Missouri, to La Salle County, in\\r\\n        1838, as also had Andrew Askeland.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [161] Helgeson may have come with Barlien from Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading spirit in the colony was undoubtedly Hans Barlien. He was\\r\\na man of great natural endowment, and he had a fair education. In\\r\\nNorway he had been a pronounced nationalist of the Wergeland direction\\r\\nand had taken part in the first peasant uprising. He was for a time a\\r\\nmember of the Storthing (the national parliament). In religion he was a\\r\\nliberal, which aroused the hostility of the clergy, while his radical\\r\\npolitical views called forth the enmity of the official class. He owned\\r\\na printing establishment at Overgaarden, and published a paper[162]\\r\\nin which he did not hesitate to give expression to the principles\\r\\nfor which he stood. This frequently involved him in litigation; and,\\r\\nfeeling himself persecuted, he at last decided to emigrate to America\\r\\nin 1837.[163] Barlien seems to be the second Norwegian emigrant from\\r\\nTrondhjem.[164] Lars Tallakson came from Bergen, while the rest of the\\r\\ncolonists were mostly from the region of Stavanger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [162] _Melkeveien_, the Milky Way.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [163] See J. B. Wist, in _Bygdejaevning_, Madison, Wisconsin, 1903,\\r\\n        p. 158; also _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_, pp.\\r\\n        235-236, and _Republikaneren_, February 9, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [164] The first was Ole Rynning. See above, p. 107, and\\r\\n        _Normaendene i Amerika_ by Knud Langeland, pp. 26-29.\\r\\nLee County was but little settled at that time;[165] land was bought\\r\\nof the Indians for a nominal price, but it often became expensive\\r\\nenough in the end, since it proved very difficult for many of the\\r\\nsettlers to obtain a clear title from the United States. This is one\\r\\nreason why the settlement did not grow, though probably not the chief\\r\\ncause. In 1843 there were between thirty and forty families, writes\\r\\nJohn Reierson,[166] but in 1856 there were, according to the census of\\r\\nthat year, only sixty-eight Norwegians in the county. This number had\\r\\nin 1885 decreased to thirty-one. In the fifties many of the settlers\\r\\nmoved to other localities, but throughout the forties there was a\\r\\nprosperous colony that contributed not a little to the development of\\r\\nthe community and the county in that early period. The settlement is of\\r\\nspecial interest in that it was the first Norwegian settlement in Iowa.\\r\\nIts founding inaugurated Norwegian colonization in the state which,\\r\\nparticularly in the fifties, resulted in the establishment of a score\\r\\nof extensive settlements in the central and the northern counties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [165] The first postoffice was established in Lee County in 1841.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [166] _Veiviser for Emigranter_, 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many reasons why the Sugar Creek Settlement did not grow\\r\\nas did the later settlements north and west. First of all, land was\\r\\nnot of the best in Lee County. And then, the locality was rather too\\r\\nfar south, Norwegians have everywhere in America thriven best in the\\r\\nmore northerly localities. Again, the tide of emigration from the\\r\\nvicinity of Stavanger was not sufficiently heavy to recruit the various\\r\\nsettlements already established by immigrants from that region. The\\r\\nmajority of those who came went direct to the Fox River Settlement in\\r\\nNorthern Illinois, which offered unsurpassed natural advantages. To\\r\\nbe sure, the Shelby County (Missouri) and the Lee County settlements\\r\\nmight have been recruited from other districts in Norway. But it must\\r\\nbe remembered that such other districts as had begun to take part in\\r\\nthe emigration movement had their attention directed just at this\\r\\ntime in another direction. The other provinces in question are Voss,\\r\\nTelemarken, and Numedal. It was representatives of these that founded\\r\\nthe Wisconsin settlements in 1839-40, and in them the great majority\\r\\nof immigrants from those provinces located in the following decade.\\r\\nThis is also true of those who came from Hardanger, Sogn,[167] and from\\r\\nWestern Norway in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [167] Immigration from Sogn was at first directed almost\\r\\n        exclusively to Boone County, Illinois, and Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still another reason why the colony did not grow. Beyond the\\r\\ncommon desire of material betterment, there was too little of community\\r\\nof interest. It is enough to mention that several different religious\\r\\nsects were represented in the little settlement, chief among which were\\r\\nthe Quakers and the Latter Day Saints. Just across the Mississippi\\r\\nwas the town of Nauvoo,[168] which was a Mormon center at the time.\\r\\nWhen the Mormons who did not believe in polygamy established themselves\\r\\nat Lamoni some years later, many Norwegians of that belief went\\r\\nwith them.[169] And not a few of the Quakers joined American Quaker\\r\\nsettlements farther north, as in Salem, Henry County.[170] In the later\\r\\nfifties a prosperous colony was founded at and south of Legrand in\\r\\nMarshall County. A few of the early pioneers, however, remained and\\r\\ntheir descendants live in Lee County to-day. Finally, the difficulty of\\r\\nsecuring a title to the land upon which many Norwegians had settled,\\r\\nto which reference has been made above, undoubtedly drove many to seek\\r\\nhomes elsewhere.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [168] In the Fox River Settlement in Illinois many Norwegians\\r\\n        joined the Mormons and later moved to Utah. Bishop Canute\\r\\n        Peterson was one of these.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [169] The Mormons first moved into Iowa in 1839, having received\\r\\n        assurance of protection and the liberty to practice their\\r\\n        belief from Governor Lucas in that year. They located in\\r\\n        Lee County not far from Sugar Creek. The town of Nauvoo,\\r\\n        Illinois, had been bought by them. The name was changed from\\r\\n        Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [170] Omund Olson was converted to Quakerism at Salem, Henry\\r\\n        County. As early as 1842 several of the settlers joined with\\r\\n        him in erecting a meeting house on his farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [171] The question has been investigated somewhat by Mr. B. L.\\r\\n        Wick. See _Republikaneren_, February 9, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these first Norwegian pioneers in Iowa I shall here add a brief\\r\\nfinal note, as we shall not meet with them again. We have met the\\r\\nbrothers Knud and Jacob Anderson Slogvig four times as the founders\\r\\nof settlements--in Orleans County, New York, in La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, in Shelby County, Missouri, and in Lee County, Iowa. Jacob\\r\\nSlogvig went to California about 1850; there he became wealthy and\\r\\ndied in 1864. Knud Slogvig moved to Lee County early in the fifties,\\r\\nI believe, and died there. Hans Barlien died in the Sugar Creek\\r\\nSettlement in 1842. Mrs. Thorstein Rue and her son, Thorstein, lived in\\r\\nSugar Creek till 1846, when they went to Wisconsin, and took part in\\r\\nthe founding of the Blue Mounds Settlement in western Dane County. Lars\\r\\nTallakson settled about a decade later in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nwhere he lived to a good old age.[172] Jacob Olson Hetletvedt (brother\\r\\nof the slooper, Ole O. Hetletvedt) continued to live in Lee County till\\r\\nhis death in August, 1857. His widow married Sven Kjylaa, with whom she\\r\\nthen moved to the Fox River Settlement. Per Omundson Gjilje was one of\\r\\nthe last to leave the settlement; in 1864 he removed to New Sharon,\\r\\nMahaska County, Iowa, where he died in 1895. His wife (born Karina\\r\\nBornevik, from Nærstrand, Norway) died in 1902, aged eighty-six.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [172] He died about 1900. Among those who moved to New Sharon were\\r\\n        Sjur Olson, Nils Nilson and Aad Nilson and wife Kristina;\\r\\n        Martha Erickson was until recently, at least, living in Clark\\r\\n        County, Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers at Wiota, La Fayette\\r\\n            County, and Dodgeville, Iowa County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout forty miles directly west of Rock Prairie lies Wiota, about which\\r\\ntown stretches in all directions a Norwegian settlement of considerable\\r\\nsize. It is separated from Luther Valley by Green County and lies\\r\\nonly twenty-five miles distant, northwest, from the old settlement of\\r\\nRock Run, in Illinois. Here extensive lead mines were being operated\\r\\nin the forties, and they were the means of drawing to that locality a\\r\\nlarge number of immigrants of different nationalities, many of whom,\\r\\nto be sure, only remained there temporarily, going elsewhere to buy\\r\\na home as soon as they had accumulated sufficient funds. The mines\\r\\nwere at that time called \"Hamilton Diggings.\" As early as 1840 we find\\r\\ntwo Norwegians working in these mines, namely, the brothers Andreas\\r\\nand John O. Week, both from Eidfjord, in Hardanger. The Week brothers\\r\\nseem to have been two of a party of about forty from Hardanger, who\\r\\nemigrated in 1839.[173] I do not believe, however, that either Andrew\\r\\nor John Week entered a land claim in the vicinity, and they remained\\r\\nthere only a few years. In 1844 John Week moved to Dodgeville in Iowa\\r\\nCounty, where he established a shoe store in company with John Lee,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, Norway. Andrew Week went to Marathon County some years\\r\\nlater; here he built a saw mill, which, however, was bought out by his\\r\\nbrother John in 1849, when Andrew joined the California gold-seekers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [173] They came in the same ship as Knut Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1842 Lars Davidson Reque, an immigrant from Voss in\\r\\nthe year 1839, came to Wiota. We have already met him as a purchaser\\r\\nof land in Deerfield Township, in Dane County, in December, 1840. Not\\r\\nhaving the means to begin the improvement of his land, he says, he\\r\\ndecided to go to Hamilton Diggings, and he did not take possession of\\r\\nhis land until the summer of 1842.[174] Rekve remained at the Diggings\\r\\nonly about one year. In 1841 the first permanent settlers arrived;\\r\\nthese were Per Unde, from Vik Parish, Sogn, Per Davidson Skjerveim,\\r\\nSjur Ulven, and Arne Anderson Vinje, from Voss. The first of those was,\\r\\nit seems, the earliest emigrant from Sogn to America. He was a man of\\r\\nconsiderable means, but a copy of Rynning\\'s _Sandfaerdig Beretning om\\r\\nAmerika_ fell into his hands and he decided to emigrate. He remained\\r\\nin Chicago the first year and a half or over. Ulven and Skjerveim had\\r\\ncome from Norway in 1840. Arne Vinje (born 1820) came to Chicago in\\r\\nSeptember, 1840, after having been five months on the journey. He had\\r\\nleft Norway April sixteenth with his wife,[175] and a party of twenty\\r\\nother persons from Voss. The following spring Vinje and Skjerveim,\\r\\nhaving decided to go to the mines in Wisconsin, secured each their\\r\\nyoke of oxen, and drove overland, arriving at Wiota on the seventh of\\r\\nJuly, after five days of difficult travel; Unde and Ulven came at the\\r\\nsame time. Unde immediately entered a claim on a piece of land in the\\r\\nvicinity and built a house, as did Skjerveim and Vinje a short time\\r\\nafter; these located, however, about three miles farther south.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [174] He did not actually settle there permanently before 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [175] Her maiden name was Martha Gulliksdatter Kindem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Arne Vinje the following twenty-one persons came from\\r\\nVoss that spring: Torstein Saue, his wife and son Gulleik, Lars Saue\\r\\nand wife, Klaus Grimestad and wife, Arne Anderson and wife and infant\\r\\nson Andrew, Knudt Hylle, Ole S. Gilderhus, Knudt Rokne, Mads Sonve,\\r\\nBaar Lawson Böe (a brother of Iver Lawson), Lars Röthe, Brynnel Ronve,\\r\\ntwo young ladies from Saue, one from Ronve and one from Gilderhus. In\\r\\ndiscussing the voyage Vinje says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The bottom of the ship in which we sailed was declared by Capt.\\r\\n  Ankerson to be one hundred and fifty years old and when, in\\r\\n  midocean, we encountered a severe storm, the timbers sustaining\\r\\n  the upper berths gave way, precipitating them upon the lower ones,\\r\\n  and the screams and cries of the frightened passengers added to\\r\\n  the fury of the storm, almost created a panic on board. As for\\r\\n  myself, I seized a heavy chest which I intended throwing overboard\\r\\n  to use as a support in the water in case the ship foundered. Even\\r\\n  Hegg, and others from \"Östlandet,\" who came from Drammen with Capt.\\r\\n  Ankerson, stopped in Milwaukee, while we from Voss came on to\\r\\n  Chicago, where my wife and I were received into the home of Sjur\\r\\n  Ulven and family. Mrs. Ulven being my wife\\'s cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Knudt Hylle and myself began our first work in Chicago upon the\\r\\n  streets of the (then) westside. My work was handling a heavy plank\\r\\n  scraper, drawn by a yoke of oxen and used to scrape the sod from\\r\\n  the sides of the road into the center.\\r\\n\\r\\n  At this time occurred the election of General Harrison to the\\r\\n  Presidency. The candidate was the \"People\\'s choice\" and I, from\\r\\n  my bed, saw a log cabin, such as he lived in, mounted upon wheels\\r\\n  and drawn through the streets to show that he was chosen from the\\r\\n  common people. That was effective electioneering!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1841 Peder Skjerveim, who had come from Norway in\\r\\n1837, having lived in Chicago in the interval, drove from Chicago up to\\r\\nHamilton Diggings to explore the region. Upon his return he reported\\r\\nthat there was government land for sale there, and Vinje and he decided\\r\\nto move thither. Peder Iverson Unde and family and Sjur Ulven went to\\r\\nthe \"Diggings\" at the same time. Of this Vinje writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n  We left Chicago on July 2nd and arrived in Wiota, or Hamilton\\'s\\r\\n  Diggings as it was then called, after a tiresome journey of five\\r\\n  days. On July 7th we passed Elgin, Illinois, in a grove near which\\r\\n  Independence day was being celebrated, on July 4th, but there was\\r\\n  then no town, only a few scattered houses. We progressed with\\r\\n  some difficulty as our wagon broke down twice during the journey.\\r\\n  The second of these accidents occurred as we were nearing Rockford\\r\\n  toward evening, when the axle gave way; but Peder Skjervheim,\\r\\n  with only an ax and an augur went into the woods nearby, and from\\r\\n  a convenient tree cut and made a new axle that night, so that we\\r\\n  proceeded safely on our way the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n  There being no bridges, we forded the rivers at Rockford and\\r\\n  Freeport. There was then not a house where the thriving city of\\r\\n  Rockford now stands and only one small grocery store at Freeport.\\r\\n  There were, at that time, no Norwegians in or around Wiota, and\\r\\n  the nearest Norwegian settlement was at Rock Run, Illinois. Peder\\r\\n  Skjervheim and I, each bought forty acres of government land in the\\r\\n  Township of Wiota, upon which we each built a log cabin and began\\r\\n  other improvements. Andres Brække also bought forty acres but soon\\r\\n  sold it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  In 1842 there came to our neighborhood three young people from\\r\\n  Voss; David Larson Fenne and wife, and his brother, Nils Fenne.\\r\\n  In 1843 there came some families from Vik, in Sogn, and settled\\r\\n  near by: Ole Iverson Unde and wife Britha, and his brother Erik\\'s\\r\\n  family. Erik died before reaching America, but his wife and\\r\\n  children settled down here. Likewise, Erik Engebrit Hove, Ole\\r\\n  Anderson and Sjur Tallakson Bruavold came at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those which Mr. Vinje mentions as arriving in 1842 may be added Isak\\r\\nJohnson from Skien,[176] and Christian Hendrickson from Lier, Norway.\\r\\nThe latter however moved to Primrose Township in Dane County in 1846.\\r\\n(See below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [176] I am told that he came in 1841, but this seems to be a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nMathias J. Engebretsen of Gratiot, Wisconsin, tells me that Per Fenne\\r\\nand wife Martha came to Wiota in 1842, while Nils Sunve and wife\\r\\nMaline, and Ivar Fenne came in 1843; all these were from Voss. Helge\\r\\nMeland and wife from Telemarken came in 1843, as also Tore Thompson\\r\\nfrom Tindal and Ashley Gunderson from Numedal.[177] Those mentioned by\\r\\nArne Vinje at the end of the above account, Ole and Sjur Bruavolden,\\r\\ndid not settle at Wiota, it seems, before 1845, and Erik E. Hove not\\r\\nuntil 1847. These had located first at Long Prairie in Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, as had also Ingebrigt Fuglegjærdet, who came from Vik, Sogn,\\r\\nin 1844. Of the immigration from Land, Norway, to Wiota, which began\\r\\nwith Syver Johnson (Smed or Smedhögen in 1844), I shall speak in the\\r\\nnext chapter. The growth of the Jefferson Prairie Settlement will,\\r\\nhowever, claim our attention briefly first.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [177] Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson, speaking of the Wiota\\r\\n        Settlement in 1844 says, that there had been organized a\\r\\n        congregation that year, which numbered about one hundred\\r\\n        members, of whom the larger part were from Voss; these,\\r\\n        he says, had settled there for the most part in 1843.

We found that a\\r\\nconsiderable number of persons had located there by 1840, principally\\r\\nimmigrants from Numedal. These first settlers located in the southern\\r\\nhalf of Clinton Township, but others soon came who settled still\\r\\nfarther south, so that the settlement soon came to include a portion\\r\\nof the Township of Manchester in Boone County, Illinois. The first\\r\\nsettlers here were Tönnes Tolleivson (or Tollefson) from Jæderen, and\\r\\nSvend Larson, both of whom settled in Boone County in 1840; Tollefson\\r\\nhad come to America in the fall of 1839, presumably spending the winter\\r\\nof 1839-40 on Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement thus came to be divided into a northern and a southern\\r\\npart, the immigrant settlers in the two representing different\\r\\nprovinces in Norway. The Numedalians settled as we have seen, nearer\\r\\nClinton and in general in the northern end of Jefferson Prairie; in\\r\\nfact they occupied most of the prairie proper. The southern portion,\\r\\nthe timber land, come to be settled principally by immigrants from\\r\\nVoss. Very few of these located in the Town of Clinton; they\\r\\nselected homes in the early days, for the most part, just where their\\r\\ndescendants now live, on the south side of the state line, in Illinois.\\r\\nThe whole settlement extends from about a mile and a half south of\\r\\nClinton across the prairie and into the timber which began about three\\r\\nmiles south of Clinton and extends about four miles down into Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have observed above that Ole Nattestad\\'s house became the stopping\\r\\nplace of the earliest immigrants to Jefferson Prairie. In a similar\\r\\nway D. B. Egery\\'s place,[178] located four miles southwest of the\\r\\nNattestad cabin on the trail to Beloit, became the headquarters for\\r\\nmany a Norwegian immigrant in that early day. Speaking of him, H. L.\\r\\nSkavlem gives testimony to his kindness and the readiness with which he\\r\\nlent a helping hand to the incoming settlers in his vicinity, who were\\r\\nseeking a place to establish a home in the wilderness. As soon as the\\r\\nimmigrants arrived, parties of two or three would fill their knapsacks\\r\\n(skræppe) with provisions and strike out in various directions to \"spy\\r\\nout the land.\"[179]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [178] Situated in section 26 in Turtle Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [179] H. L. Skavlem in _Scandinavians in the Early Days of Rock\\r\\n        County_, a most interesting and valuable pamphlet, though\\r\\n        very brief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegians to buy land on Jefferson Prairie were Ansten\\r\\nNattestad and Thorstein Nilsen, the date of whose purchase is December\\r\\n25th, 1839.[180] On January 25, 1840, Anders Jacobson\\'s purchase\\r\\nwas recorded, and further in the same year those of Erik Gudbrandson\\r\\n(May 16) and Kittil Newhouse (Nyhus, June 15). The first three\\r\\npurchases were in sections 32, 30 and 22, respectively, while those of\\r\\nGudbrandson and Newhouse were in section 20, all in Clinton Township.\\r\\nThe latter made a further purchase in 1842 in the same section, as did\\r\\nalso Tosten Olson. Ole Nattestad\\'s purchase was recorded on November\\r\\n25, 1842, while in September of that year Ole Newhouse (Nyhus) had\\r\\nbought three forties in sections 15 and 22, and Christoffer Newhouse\\r\\none in section 30; others were now rapidly moving in and becoming\\r\\nowners of their choice of land on the \"Prairie.\" Among these were Jas.\\r\\nHilbeitson, Erik Hilbeitson, Tore Helgeson, Erik Gulbeitson, Gulbrand\\r\\nGulbrandson, and Ole Pederson Bogstrandeiet, all in the fall of 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [180] The first Norwegian land owner in the county was however\\r\\n        Gisle Sebjörnson Halland as shown by H. L. Skavlem\\'s\\r\\n        researches. The date of Halland\\'s purchase was November 29th.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection it may be noted that Gulleik Gravdal\\'s purchase of\\r\\nland in the Town of Newark (in section 1) was recorded December 12,\\r\\n1839, and he made additions to his holdings in 1842 in sections 1 and\\r\\n9. Mrs. Gunnild Ödegaarden purchased land in 1839 and 1840, Lars H.\\r\\nSkavlem in June, 1841, and Gudbrand Olson and Mrs. Gulleik Springen\\r\\nin October, 1841. During September of the latter year four purchases\\r\\nwere also recorded in Plymouth Township, namely those of Paul Halvorson\\r\\nSkavlem, Nils Olson Vegli (Wagley) and Gunnel Holgerson, while in May,\\r\\n1840, Gulleik H. Blakestad Skavlem had become the owner of forty acres\\r\\nin Beloit Township.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [181] In December, 1842, Mrs. Gisle Halland bought forty acres in\\r\\n        Beloit Township. Her name appears as Margarett Nutes (Margrit\\r\\n        Knutsdatter).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jefferson Prairie Settlement received considerable accessions\\r\\nduring the next four years. Lena Sondal came in 1841, Haakon Paulson\\r\\nfrom Sigdal and his wife Inger came in 1842, Ole Severtson and family\\r\\nfrom Numedal, including a daughter, Petra, who is now Mrs. Henry\\r\\nJacobson (Oppedal)[182] of Clinton, came in 1843, as did also Brynild\\r\\nL. Lie and wife from Voss, Lars O. Lie from Hallingdal[183] and\\r\\nEdwin O. Wilson Næshaug. The last of these settled in Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, where he bought land in 1846, but removed to Filmore County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1854. Gunder Vedfald and family, including the sons, Ole\\r\\nand Halvor, from Telemarken also came in 1843. In the year 1844 there\\r\\nwas a considerable influx of settlers from Voss;[184] among them were:\\r\\nSjur K. Kvarma wife and four children from Voss, Brynild Dugstad,[185]\\r\\nwife and five children, Erik K. Dugstad, wife and child, Lewis Severts,\\r\\nOle Shipley and wife Guri, Lars Grane, Sjur Grane, Elling Ellingson\\r\\nand wife Magela, Ole Skutle,[186] Peder Bere and wife Britha. Also the\\r\\nfollowing came about the same time (1844 or the following year): Lars\\r\\nBaarson and wife Gudve, Guru Isakson, Sjur A. Grönlien, wife and two\\r\\nchildren, and Erik E. Slæen. Nearly all those here enumerated followed\\r\\nthe lead of Clas Isakson and settled near or south of the state line.\\r\\nFrom Vik, Sogn, Norway, there was a single settler, namely, Ole O.\\r\\nTrain. From Hardanger also there was, it seems, only one immigrant\\r\\namong those who came during this earliest period, Anna Tollefson, wife\\r\\nof Tönnes Tollefson, who, as we have seen, came to America in 1839.\\r\\nFrom Telemarken there were about twelve persons, among them Steinar E.\\r\\nHadland, wife and son, Guldmond; Gunder O. Vedfald, wife and daughter;\\r\\nEven Haatvedt and Ole A. Haatvedt and wife, besides the Vedfald family\\r\\nspoken of above. From Næs in Hallingdal we find Knud R. Væterud, a\\r\\nwidower, and his two daughters, Ingeborg and Rönnau, besides Lars O.\\r\\nLie, and from Modum, Thov Modum and wife Karen; finally Krödsherred is\\r\\nrepresented by Even Fingerson Foslien.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [182] Henry Jacobson is a son of Jacob J. Oppedal, who came from\\r\\n        Hardanger in 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [183] Frederik Frederikson\\'s wife, who was Martha Larson, also came\\r\\n        in 1843. Frederikson came some years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [184] We have seen that Clas Isakson had immigrated from Voss in\\r\\n        1840. He was the first Vossing to settle on Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [185] Brynild Dugstad located in the northern part of the\\r\\n        settlement. A son, Knut B. Dugstad, died at Clinton, Wis., in\\r\\n        April, 1905, age 80.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [186] Ole Skutle later married Lena Sondal, who had come in 1841;\\r\\n        see above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest purchasers of land (1842) I have mentioned Ole C.\\r\\nNewhouse. He was a brother of Kristoffer and Kittil Newhouse who had\\r\\ncome in 1839. The original name, Nyhus, was in the early days changed\\r\\nto Newhouse, which is a translation of the Norwegian. Ole Newhouse\\r\\nmarried Helen Stabæk, daughter of Klemet Stabæk, who has been spoken\\r\\nof as the founder of the Rock Run Settlement in Stephenson County,\\r\\nIllinois, in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\nSjur Kvarme\\'s children included a son, Kolbein (born 1831); he lived\\r\\non Jefferson Prairie from 1844-1854, in which latter year he joined\\r\\nthe gold-seekers in California. With the proceeds of three years\\' work\\r\\nin the gold mines he came east again in 1857 and bought a farm near\\r\\nSt. Ansgar, Iowa, where he lived till his death in October, 1906. Olav\\r\\nVedfald, son of Gunder Vedfald, remained with his parents on Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie till 1850, when he purchased land and settled on Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nin Columbia County, Wisconsin.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [187] Of those who come in 1844 from Numedal were Gulleik Svensrud\\r\\n        and family, who however removed to Blue Mounds, Dane County,\\r\\n        in 1847. In 1860 he married Ingeborg Lohn who died in 1903;\\r\\n        there are five living children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the pioneers of Jefferson Prairie are also particularly to be\\r\\nnamed Reverend O. Andrewson and wife, Ragnild Paulson, both of whom\\r\\ncame to America in 1841, but did not settle in Clinton Township before\\r\\n1855; in that year Rev. Andrewson accepted a call as pastor of the\\r\\ncongregation which he had organized there in 1850. Mrs. Andrewson, who\\r\\nis now eighty-five years old, is still living there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the above survey of the growth of the Jefferson Prairie Settlement\\r\\nduring these years many names have been omitted because of the\\r\\nuncertainty among my informants as to the year of their arrival. In\\r\\na subsequent chapter I shall also outline the subsequent growth of\\r\\nthe settlement. I shall here merely note the fact that Reverend J. W.\\r\\nC. Dietrichson speaks of the congregation in 1844 as numbering 150\\r\\nmembers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Immigration to Rock Prairie from Numedal and\\r\\n                  Land in 1842 and Subsequent Years._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XI above we have given an account of the beginnings of the\\r\\nRock Prairie Settlement and traced its growth down to 1842. We shall\\r\\nhere briefly discuss the development of this settlement during the\\r\\nnext eight years. Already in the summer of 1842 a considerable number\\r\\nof immigrants came, most of them locating there permanently. I shall\\r\\nmention first Halvor N. Aaen and wife, Guri (Frögne), both from Nore in\\r\\nNumedal, who settled in Newark.[188] Halvor Stordok and Ole Stordok,\\r\\nbrothers of Gunnul Stordok mentioned before, both came in 1842. Halvor\\r\\nbought land near Sugar River Bottom; he married Ingeborg Paulson, and\\r\\nthe couple lived on the homestead till their death. Their children,\\r\\nKnud, Halvor, Inge and Ingeborg, all unmarried, are still living there.\\r\\nThey are all over fifty years of age now. Ole Stordok, who married\\r\\nAnne Sand from Rollaug, located at Sand Prairie, five miles south of\\r\\nBroadhead. In the same year came also Gullik O. Mygstue, with wife\\r\\nJöran and five children, from Vægli, Numedal. Gullik died in 1852, but\\r\\nthe widow lived till 1887. Their oldest son, Ole (born in 1825), had\\r\\nlearned the trade of a shoemaker and conducted a shoemaker\\'s shop on\\r\\nhis farm long after he had begun farming.[189] In 1848 he married Sive\\r\\nEspeset from Hallingdal, Norway; they had no children. [190]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [188] Aaen is said to have been something of an inventor. He made\\r\\n        two clocks, one of which was bought by Mr. Chrispinson; the\\r\\n        other was bought by Simon Strand, and is now probably in\\r\\n        the possession of Stone or Gunild Strand says a writer in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ for March 15th, 1907. Aaen died about 1886.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [189] The location of his farm is half a mile from Orfordville.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [190] Mrs. Mygstue died in 1892. Ole Mygstue then sold his farm and\\r\\n        moved to his sister, Mrs. Engen, in Primrose, Dane County. An\\r\\n        obituary notice of Ole Mygstue (who died in 1902) speaks very\\r\\n        highly of him as a member of the church and a citizen. He was\\r\\n        a man of kindly nature and helpful spirit in whom all reposed\\r\\n        implicit confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came from Numedal to America in 1842 was also Herbrand\\r\\nH. Berge (born in Rollaug in 1821). He remained for a year and a half\\r\\non Jefferson Prairie, however, so that he did not locate on Rock\\r\\nPrairie until early in 1844. Anna Torbjörnsdatter, who later became\\r\\nhis wife (1847) also immigrated in 1842. They removed to Jackson\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota, in 1876; he died there in December, 1903, and she in\\r\\nFebruary, 1904,[191] at the age of seventy-seven. In 1843 Hellik Olson\\r\\nHoltan with family from Flesberg in Numedal emigrated and settled on\\r\\nRock Prairie. Holtan was a man of much intelligence and strength of\\r\\ncharacter, who soon came to hold a leading place among the pioneers in\\r\\nthe community.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [191] Their children are: Paul Berge, Herbrand Berge and Mrs. Henry\\r\\n        Anderson, all living in Jackson, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far we have spoken only of immigrants from Numedal. In the year 1842\\r\\nthe first family from Land, Norway, came to Rock Prairie, namely Hans\\r\\nSmedsrud and wife. We have seen that the first immigrant from Land,\\r\\nLars Röste, who came in 1839, located at Rock Run. It was the year\\r\\n1843 which inaugurated the tide of emigration to America from Land and\\r\\nnearly all the earliest arrivals located on Rock Prairie. Thus in that\\r\\nyear came Harald Ommelstad and family, five in all, Anders Lundsæter\\r\\nand family, in all five, Peder H. Gaarder with family (six), Sören\\r\\nSörum, and Anne Marie Nilsdatter, in all eighteen persons. These were\\r\\nfollowed the next year by fifteen persons, namely: Lars Nord-Fossum\\r\\nand family (five), Hans Christofferson Tollefsrude and wife, Anders\\r\\nMidböen with wife and one child, Anders Engen, Gudbrand Gaarder, Helene\\r\\nGaarder, Inger Gaarder, and Helene Klevmoen. Anders Erstad and wife,\\r\\nand Syver Smed, who came at the same time, did not locate on Rock\\r\\nPrairie; the former went to Rock Run while Smed located at Wiota, being\\r\\nthe first native of Land to settle in La Fayette County.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall also add here the names of those who came from Land in the\\r\\nfollowing years. In 1845 came two families, namely Askild Ullensager,\\r\\nwife and four children, and Tarald Jörandlien, wife and four children.\\r\\nJörandlien or Jorlien, as the name is usually rendered, located\\r\\nin Newark. In 1846 Marie Engen and her son, Hans (born 1823) and\\r\\ndaughter, came, as did also Erik Nederhaugen. The year 1847 brought\\r\\nOle Nörstelien, Christine Nörstelien and Hans Sveum, wife and five\\r\\nchildren.[192] The year 1848 with its extensive immigration also\\r\\nbrought an increased contingent from Land. The following settled on\\r\\nRock Prairie; Ole Gaarder and wife, Andreas Sörum, Ingebrigt Fossum and\\r\\nfamily (six), Halvor Ruud and family (seven), Johans Nederhaugen[193]\\r\\nand family (four), Johan Frankrige and family (five) and Hovel\\r\\nJensvold,[194] Hovel Smeby and Bertha Lybæk.[195] In all there were\\r\\nfifty-four who came from Land in 1848; of these, twenty-eight settled\\r\\non Rock Prairie, twenty-five at Wiota and one at Rock Run. The roster\\r\\nof immigrants from Land in 1849 includes forty-eight persons, of whom\\r\\nsixteen located on Rock Prairie; they were: Johannes Ommelstadsæteren,\\r\\nIngeborg Ommelstadsæteren, Marthea Brendingen, Johans Lybæk, Bertha\\r\\nFröslie, Marit Fröslie, Hans Engen (Fröslieit) and family (five) and\\r\\nJonas Gjerdet and family (five). Syver Gaarder and family, thirteen in\\r\\nall, who located farther west at Albany, Green County, came directly\\r\\nfrom Land, but they were natives of Valders. He had moved from Valders\\r\\nto Torpen in Land and bought there the Gaarder farm when the Gaarder\\r\\nfamily emigrated in 1843, remaining there, however, as we have seen,\\r\\nonly six years.[196] The accessions for 1850 were: Ole Smeby and family\\r\\n(five), Östen Lundsæteren and family (five), Sjugal Frankrige and\\r\\nfamily (six), Helene Fröslie, Bertha Sörum, Hovel Fossum, Ole Hovdelien\\r\\nand Hans Værhaug, in all twenty-one.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [192] Svend Nörstelien and family (seven) and Kari Lillebæk and six\\r\\n        children from Land, who also came that year, settled in Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [193] Martin Johnson of Orfordville, Rock County, is his son.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [194] Christian Lunde, who also came from Land in 1848, located at\\r\\n        Rock Run. Several families went to Wiota; see above, Chapter\\r\\n        XXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [195] Who later married Syver Midböen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [196] Of the remaining twenty-three of this year\\'s immigration\\r\\n        from Land eleven went to Wiota, seven to Rock Run, and five\\r\\n        scattered elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe account of immigration from Land which it has been possible\\r\\nto give so fully here is based on the private records of Hans C.\\r\\nTollefsrude, as published in part in _Amerika_ for March 8th, 1907.\\r\\nHans Tollefsrude\\'s name occupies a foremost place in the early history\\r\\nof the Rock Prairie Settlement. In the seventies he again became a\\r\\npioneer, locating now in Pocahontas County, Iowa.[197]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [197] The limitations of space forbid a sketch of Mr. Tollefsrude\\r\\n        in our survey of Rock Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Immigration from Hallingdal, Norway, to Rock\\r\\n            Prairie from 1843 to 1848. Continued Immigration\\r\\n                 from Numedal. Other Early Accessions._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will now turn to another contingent in the early immigration to Rock\\r\\nPrairie,--that from the dialect district of Hallingdal. The emigration\\r\\nfrom this region began in 1842 with the departure of the brothers\\r\\nKnud and John Ellingson Solem, who came direct to Rock Prairie. In\\r\\n1843 Kleofas Halvorson Hansemoen immigrated with wife Kari (Onsgaard)\\r\\nand child Halvor, locating on section twelve in Newark Township, Rock\\r\\nCounty.[198] Kleofas\\'s father\\'s name was Halvor Kleofasen Hansemoen;\\r\\nhe did not emigrate. There were two other brothers, Erik and Hans, of\\r\\nwhom the former did not come to this country. Hans Hansemoen had in\\r\\nNorway bought an estate called Husemoen, not intending to emigrate.\\r\\nBut when his brother sent favorable reports back from America, he sold\\r\\nout and came to this country in the fall of 1845. He bought land in\\r\\nsections eleven and twelve in Newark Township, near his brother. The\\r\\nabove is narrated in part to show how his name happens to appear as\\r\\nHans Husemoen, while the brother is Kleofas Hansemoen and the brother\\'s\\r\\nchildren are Halvor Kleofas, Knud Kleofas, etc. (see note 198). Hans\\r\\nHusemoen\\'s wife\\'s maiden name was Bergit Halvorsdatter Tveto; she was\\r\\nfrom Aal Parish in Hallingdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [198] They had five children in this country: Knud, Kleofas,\\r\\n        Eyvind, Eirik and Caroline, all now married and with\\r\\n        families. The sons adopted Cleofas as the family name. The\\r\\n        daughter was married to Kittil Haugen, now living in Pelican\\r\\n        Rapids, Minn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1845 the settlement received other accessions from Hallingdal. The\\r\\nlist includes: Ola Brunsvold, Halvor Hesgard, Kristen Grimsgaard,\\r\\nOle Skaalen, Nils Roe, Ola Sando, Mikkel Rust, Svend Hesla, Gjermund\\r\\nMæhtum, Aslak Rustad and Aslak Ulsak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 about three hundred persons emigrated from Hallingdal. How many\\r\\nof these came to Rock County I am not able to say; among them were,\\r\\nhowever, Erik Kolsrud and family, Ole Hei and family, Nils Haugen,\\r\\nwife and six children, Knud Tröstem, Henrik Henriksen Tröstem, Halvor\\r\\nNess, Hans Engen, Kari Husemoen, Guttorm Roen and son, Ole, Tollef\\r\\nTollefsrud-Ballandby and sons Nils, Ola and Amund, Henrik Rime, brother\\r\\nof Tollef, A. T. Beigo, Timan Burtness and his brother John, Aadne\\r\\nEngen, Kristen Megaarden, Lars Grimsgaard, wife and family, Ingeborg\\r\\nOlsdatter Tröstem, Asle Hesla, and Asle Brunsvold. Many of the above\\r\\nhad families. The leaders of this party were the three first named and\\r\\nTollef Tollefsrude. They were the owners of large estates in Norway\\r\\nwhich they sold when they left for America. They paid the passage for\\r\\nmany who came from Hallingdal that summer, but I cannot give the names\\r\\nof these. The party of emigrants left Drammen in April by the ship\\r\\n_Newmann_, which took them to Havre, France. Here they remained one\\r\\nmonth, before the ship on which they were to sail was gotten ready.\\r\\nThey did not arrive to Rock Prairie until October, having been six\\r\\nmonths en route.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1847 very few came from Hallingdal, among them are mentioned Ole\\r\\nOnsgaard, Nils O. Wikko,[199] and Östen Burtness. In the following\\r\\nyear, however, there was a considerable immigration. Erik K. Berg and\\r\\nhis brother Truls Berg, Ole Trulson Ve and Ole Gulsen (Tröstem) with\\r\\nwife and son Gul and daughter Guri, Erik Ovestrud, Tideman Kvarve,\\r\\nGuttorm Megaarden, a Mr. Sagdalen and wife, Kari,[200] Levor Kvarve\\r\\nand family of twelve, and Knut Guttormsen Tyrebakken.[201] There came\\r\\nothers from Hallingdal also in the years following. I may mention\\r\\nhere Ole J. Bakke and wife and Herbrand K. Finseth (born in Hemsedal\\r\\nin July, 1830), who emigrated in 1852 and lived three years on Rock\\r\\nPrairie. They moved to Goodhue County, Minnesota, in 1855, as did also\\r\\nKnut K. Finseth and A. K. Finseth, brothers of Herbrand; these together\\r\\nwith Halvor Hesgard, Aadne Engen and Christen Evenson, who removed to\\r\\nMinnesota at the same time, were the first white settlers in the Town\\r\\nof Holden, Goodhue County.[202] I may also mention Kittel O. Ruud, born\\r\\n1823 of parents Erik Sanderson and Margit Ruud, and who came to Rock\\r\\nCounty in 1850. A few years later he moved to Northwestern Iowa and in\\r\\n1855 became a pioneer settler in Holdon, Goodhue County, Minnesota,\\r\\nwhere he married Margrethe Andersdatter Flom in 1856. She was born in\\r\\nAurland, Sogn, 1824. She died in March and he in April, 1903.[203]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [199] Nils O. Wikko was from Gol, Hallingdal. He married Beret\\r\\n        Halvorson in 1854, and removed soon after to Worth County,\\r\\n        Iowa. He died in 1904, at the age of eighty-three, survived\\r\\n        by widow and six daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [200] They moved to Houston County, Minnesota, in 1853. He died in\\r\\n        1894 and she in 1904, at the age of eighty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [201] Tyrebakken moved to Black Hammer, Minnesota, in 1854, when he\\r\\n        married Mari Haugejordet. He was born in 1823, in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [202] Knut Finseth died in 1869. Herbrand Finseth married Guri\\r\\n        Ouri in 1867; he died in January, 1901, leaving wife and six\\r\\n        children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [203] I gather these facts from an obituary notice, which speaks at\\r\\n        length in eloquent terms of the noble lives of this couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigrants from Hallingdal settled chiefly in Spring Valley, and\\r\\nPlymouth; Beloit and Newark townships were settled for the most part\\r\\nbefore the Hallingdal immigrants began to come in larger numbers,\\r\\nyet some are located in Beloit Township. Newark is occupied largely\\r\\nby immigrants from Numedal, as is also Beloit. While Rock Prairie\\r\\nwas taken possession of chiefly by pioneers from Numedal, Land,\\r\\nand Hallingdal, there were also a few from Telemarken, Sigdal and\\r\\nRingerike, and one from Valders among the pioneers of the forties.\\r\\nOf those who came from Telemarken I shall mention Knut Simon (born\\r\\n1819), who located near Janesville in 1843. He removed to Rice County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1854, and thence to Pope County in 1865; died in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single immigrant from Valders to locate on Rock Prairie was Guul\\r\\nGuttormson. He came in 1843 and is the first known American immigrant\\r\\nfrom that district. He was born at Ildjernstadhaug in Hedalen in 1816.\\r\\nAbout 1840 he had removed to Modum; here a copy of Nattestad\\'s journal\\r\\nfell into his hands and he and Hans Uhlen and Anders Aamodt[204]\\r\\ndecided to emigrate. These three came on the same ship that brought\\r\\nKleofas Halvorson and Peder Gaarder. Guttormson bought land half way\\r\\nbetween Orfordville and Broadhead. He was always called \"Guul Valdris\"\\r\\nfor he was and remained the only \"Valdris\"[205] there, for while he\\r\\nwrote home urging his friends in Valders to come to America, the\\r\\nimmigration from Valders did not set in before 1847-48 and by that time\\r\\nRock Prairie had been, as we have seen, taken up largely by immigrants\\r\\nfrom Hallingdal and Land. Guul Guttormson\\'s oldest son, Guttorm Guul\\r\\n(Broadhead, Wisconsin), born August, 1848, was probably the first child\\r\\nborn of Valdris parentage in America. I have already spoken of the\\r\\nemigration of Syver Gaarder,[206] a \"Valdris\" who came with the party\\r\\nfrom Land in 1849. They located at Albany in Green County. These I\\r\\nbelieve were the only settlers from Valders in this locality.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [204] These two were the first to emigrate to America from Modum.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [205] Valdris is the Norwegian appellation of a native of Valders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [206] Syver Gaarder\\'s daughter, Barbro, married Martin Johnson\\r\\n        (Nederhaugen) in 1855. Dr. J. S. Johnson, of Minneapolis,\\r\\n        is their oldest son; other children are: Ben Johnson,\\r\\n        Orfordville, Wisconsin; Mrs. Rev. Langseth, Glendorado,\\r\\n        Minn.; Mrs. Rev. L. Njus, McIntosh, Minn.; Mrs. Strömseth,\\r\\n        living on the homestead; Mandy Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Economic Conditions of Immigrants. Cost of Passage.\\r\\n                    Course of the Journey. Duration\\r\\n                            of the Journey._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn discussing the causes of emigration, we have found that economic\\r\\nfactors entered extensively into operation. It was the desire for\\r\\nmaterial betterment that prompted a very large proportion of Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants to leave the land of their fathers. The first five decades\\r\\nof Norwegian emigration was a period in which the battle for existence\\r\\namong the Norwegian peasant and the common man was none too easy.\\r\\nUnfavorable economic conditions, the oppressive methods of the\\r\\nlarger land owners, frequent crop failure, often reduced the lesser\\r\\nfarmers into a condition of impoverishment. Even wealthy families\\r\\nfound themselves burdened by debts from which the future seemed to\\r\\noffer little hope of relief. By the law of primogeniture the oldest\\r\\nson inherited the estate. The sons of men of means, therefore, were\\r\\nfinancially often no better situated than the cotter\\'s son, and were\\r\\noften forced to seek their fortune beyond the native village or\\r\\ndistrict. These considerations will make clear first that the great\\r\\nmajority of Norwegian emigrants to the United States were at the time\\r\\nof emigration of small means; they were often very poor indeed. Their\\r\\nwealth lay in the ability and the will to carve their way in a land\\r\\nof greater promise. Their wealth lay also in their thrift, in their\\r\\nideals, and the moral fiber of their race. Many of those who have\\r\\nsucceeded best in their adopted country came here well-nigh penniless.\\r\\nTo them poverty was no longer a curse when the path of opportunity lay\\r\\nbefore them. But the above considerations will also have indicated\\r\\nthat Norwegian immigrants of that early period were not always of the\\r\\npoor classes even though they came here with little or nothing. Later\\r\\nNorwegian immigration has, it is true, generally been from among the\\r\\nimpecunious. But in that early period, especially 1835 to 1865, a very\\r\\nlarge number of the immigrants came from families which general or\\r\\nspecial conditions had suddenly so reduced to conditions which became\\r\\nto them intolerable. And it was the hope which America held out which\\r\\ninspired them with the will to seek there the independence now no\\r\\nlonger theirs. We have already met with the evidence of this in such\\r\\nfamilies as Hovland (1835), Nattestad (1837), Aadland (1837), Aasland\\r\\n(1838), Gravdal (1839), Stabæk (1839), Gitle Danielson (1839), Luraas\\r\\n(1839), Unde (1839), Heg (1840), Gaarder (1843-49), Nils Haugen (1846),\\r\\nand many others. We shall in the following pages meet with families\\r\\nof considerable means from Numedal, Telemarken, Voss, Ringsaker and\\r\\nelsewhere, of whom the same is true; and among the pioneers who came\\r\\nfrom Sogn in 1844, 1845, and later there were many old families of\\r\\nproperty and prominence in their native community. I stress this fact\\r\\nbecause some who have formerly written about Norwegian settlements in\\r\\nthis country have never yet fully recognized the full significance\\r\\nof this; but I speak of it here especially because I have myself\\r\\nalso failed to fully appreciate this fact when last I wrote upon\\r\\nthe subject. What has been said here applies to the founders of the\\r\\nsettlements of Northern Illinois, of Racine, Rock, Dane and other\\r\\ncounties in Southern Wisconsin, and many of those who some years later\\r\\nestablished the settlements in Northern Iowa and Southern Minnesota.\\r\\nOn the other hand also some of those who later became most substantial\\r\\nmembers of these settlements were men whose transportation to America\\r\\nwas paid for by others that they might come and get a start in life.\\r\\nThese men emigrated prompted by the desire of material betterment and\\r\\nin that aim they have succeeded, and they have succeeded honestly,\\r\\noften accumulating great wealth.[207]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [207] It is only \"financial prosperity\" which we are here speaking\\r\\n        of, of course. The question of \"success\" is entirely a\\r\\n        different one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second topic in the title of this chapter is the cost of passage. I\\r\\nshall discuss this item briefly, using concrete illustrations from our\\r\\nsources. In that early period the voyage was made by sail-ships. These\\r\\ncontinued to be used for a long time after steam had come into use,\\r\\nclear down into the seventies. The ticket was then generally somewhat\\r\\ncheaper by sailing vessels than by steamship. Passengers furnished\\r\\ntheir own board and beading, and they were required to bring a supply\\r\\nsufficient for ten to twelve weeks.[208] The price of passage ranged\\r\\nbetween 33 and 50 _speciedaler_, that is between $25.00 and $38.00.\\r\\nChildren under fourteen travelled for half price; those under one went\\r\\nfree. The Luraas party (page 158 above) paid forty-two _speciedaler_\\r\\nfrom Gothenburg to Boston, while the Nattestad party paid fifty dollars\\r\\nfrom Gothenburg to New York in 1837. In 1839 the party that came with\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad secured passage for thirty-three dollars per person.\\r\\nThis may be regarded as normal; it was the price paid, e. g., by\\r\\nAnders Tömmerstigen and family from Christiania via Havre, France,\\r\\nto New York in 1846. Those who came in June from Sogn in 1844 paid\\r\\ntwenty-five dollars a person from Bergen to New York. The extremes are\\r\\nillustrated by two groups for the year 1839 and 1845: The little group\\r\\nof immigrants who came from Stavanger via Gothenburg to Boston with\\r\\nGitle Danielson in 1839 paid, it seems, sixty dollars apiece,[209]\\r\\nwhile Peder Aasmundson Tanger and others, ninety in all, who came in\\r\\n1845 from Kragerö, paid only eighteen dollars apiece to New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [208] The regulations varying with different ships, _Juno_, which\\r\\n        brought the first party from Inner Sogn in 1844, did not\\r\\n        accept any passenger who had not provided himself with food\\r\\n        supply for twelve weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [209] i. e. $47. R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 313.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inland journey, generally in the early days made by canal boat,\\r\\nvaried greatly in cost, often amounting to as much as fourteen dollars\\r\\nto Milwaukee or Chicago. But the additional toll inland frequently\\r\\nmade the inland journey much more expensive than was the ocean voyage.\\r\\nOne pioneer, writing of this later, says that his whole journey cost\\r\\nhim ninety dollars.[210] In the fifties the inland journey was made by\\r\\nrailroad; the railroad ticket from Quebec to Chicago or Milwaukee was\\r\\neight dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [210] In American money, of which less than half for the ocean voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of the journey has been incidentally indicated above.\\r\\nDuring the first years it was usually by way of Gothenburg, sometimes\\r\\nvia Hamburg, not infrequently by way of Havre. The starting point was\\r\\nStavanger, Bergen, Skien, Drammen, Porsgrund and Christiania, later\\r\\nother ports. New York was most often the place of landing, but not\\r\\ninfrequently Boston, in isolated instances, Fall River, Philadelphia\\r\\nand New Orleans. After 1850 sail-ships plied extensively between\\r\\nScandinavian ports and Quebec.[211] The inland journey from New York\\r\\nwent by steamboat to Albany, thence by canal boat to Buffalo, a\\r\\ndistance of three hundred and fifty miles, which usually took twelve\\r\\ndays but often over two weeks.[212] From Buffalo the journey went\\r\\nby steamboat over the Great Lakes to Milwaukee and Chicago, after\\r\\n1842 usually to Milwaukee. Those who took the Quebec route after 1850\\r\\nwere then brought to St. Levi by the railroad company\\'s steamboats,\\r\\nwhence they went by rail to Chicago or Milwaukee,[213] a journey which\\r\\ngenerally took four or five days,[214] over a distance of 1020 miles.\\r\\nMilwaukee-bound passengers were often shipped from Port Huron by way\\r\\nof Lakes Huron and Michigan or were taken by rail from Detroit across\\r\\nMichigan to Grand Haven, thence by steamboat across Lake Michigan to\\r\\nMilwaukee.[215] The latter was of course the shorter and the favored\\r\\nroute for immigrants whose destination was Wisconsin, Northern Iowa, or\\r\\nMinnesota. Immigrants who landed in Boston usually went by steamboat\\r\\nthence to New York and from the regular inland route as given above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [211] Of the trials and the hardships of the ocean voyage in\\r\\n        the thirties, forties and fifties, we can to-day have no\\r\\n        conception. It would, however, fall outside the scope\\r\\n        of this work to discuss that here. I may refer the\\r\\n        reader to a well-written article by H. Cock Jensen in\\r\\n        _Nordmandsforbundet_, December, 1907, pages 53-66. See also\\r\\n        Holand\\'s article, pages 56-60.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [212] A good account of the character of this journey is given by\\r\\n        Holand, pages 65-74.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [213] Via Montreal, Toronto, Port Huron and Detroit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [214] _Billed-Magazin_ I, 123-124, article \"Om Udvandringen,\" by J.\\r\\n        A. Johnson Skipsnes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [215] To Port Huron 189 miles, thence to Milwaukee 85 miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duration of the journey was always a matter of great uncertainty.\\r\\nIntending emigrants who came from the interior of Norway often had to\\r\\nwait as long as two weeks at Bergen or Skien, as the case might be,\\r\\nbefore the ships on which they were to go sailed. The overhauling and\\r\\nputting in repair of the storm-battered ships often took weeks.[216]\\r\\nThe duration of the voyage across the Atlantic depended of course\\r\\nlargely upon the state of the weather. With this favorable a sail-boat\\r\\nwould usually cross the ocean in six or seven weeks,[217] but in a\\r\\nvoyage of such a distance it was practically certain that there would\\r\\nbe stormy weather sometime before the other side was reached. In his\\r\\nanswer to this question in _Billed-Magazin_ I, page 123, John A.\\r\\nJohnson wrote that the average length was seven weeks, but he adds that\\r\\nthose who crossed in that time had no reason to complain. And he speaks\\r\\nof the fact that emigrant ships have in rare cases taken twelve to\\r\\nthirteen weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [216] The author\\'s grandfather, Ole Torjussen Flom, and party of\\r\\n        about fifty-three, from Inner Sogn, were obliged to wait in\\r\\n        Bergen nearly three weeks before sailing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [217] There was of course great difference in the speed of the\\r\\n        boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nattestad party made, in 1837, an especially short voyage of\\r\\nthirty-two days from Gothenburg to Fall River. I have no record of\\r\\nany other ship in those early years which sailed so well as did\\r\\n_Enigheden_. _Juno_, the most rapid sailer on the Atlantic in the\\r\\nforties, crossed in five weeks and three days in May-June, 1844, which\\r\\nKristi Melaas of Stoughton, Wisconsin, who was a passenger, says broke\\r\\nthe record for speed at that time. Ansten Nattestad and party took\\r\\nnine weeks in 1839 with the ship _Emelia_ from Drammen. Nine weeks\\r\\nis the number which many report as the duration of the voyage in the\\r\\nforties. The party that came with the Luraas brothers from Tin and\\r\\nGitle Danielson from Stavanger also in 1839 took nine weeks and three\\r\\ndays from Gothenburg to Boston. And _Aegir_ took nine weeks on its\\r\\njourney from Bergen to New York in 1837. The sloop _Restaurationen_ we\\r\\nrecall crossed in ten weeks. The so-called Brook-ship _Albion_ usually\\r\\nrequired from eight to nine weeks for the voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn stormy weather the voyage sometimes lasted as much as fourteen\\r\\nweeks. The sail-ship _Tricolor_ took that long in April-July, 1845, the\\r\\nroute being from Porsgrund to New York. Ingebrigt Johnson Helle, from\\r\\nKragerö, who was a passenger, writes of the terrors of this journey\\r\\n(see appendix 2). On a voyage made in 1848 _Tricolor_ took fourteen\\r\\nweeks and four days, according to interview with Kari Gulliksdatter\\r\\nMogen (from Flesberg, Numedal), who was a passenger on the ship\\r\\n(see _Billed-Magazin_ I, page 388). The little sail-ship in which\\r\\nNils Hansen Fjeld and family came in 1847 took fourteen weeks from\\r\\nChristiania to New York.[218]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [218] For account of the voyage see Appendix 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection I shall cite from an article by Dr. K. M. Teigen of\\r\\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, entitled \"Pionerliv\" (Pioneer Life).[219] He\\r\\nsays:\\r\\n\\r\\n  In the days of the sail-ship a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean\\r\\n  was more of an undertaking than a journey around the world now.\\r\\n  Most of the summer might be required for it if the weather was\\r\\n  unfavorable. My mother\\'s party from Flesberg and Lyngdal parishes\\r\\n  in Numedal, took seven weeks and four days in 1843 with the brig\\r\\n  _Hercules_, Captain Overvind, between Drammen and New York; my\\r\\n  father\\'s company from Sogndal in Inner Sogn, three years later, lay\\r\\n  for fourteen weeks heaving and lunging in contrary winds between\\r\\n  Bergen and the promised land. And then came the journey by steamer\\r\\n  up the Hudson to Troy, thence through the \"canal\" and the sluices\\r\\n  at Oswego by canal boats, which were drawn with a snail\\'s pace by\\r\\n  horses, lazily moving along the banks; then by way of the lakes\\r\\n  by steamer again westward to Milwaukee. For this journey of about\\r\\n  a thousand miles another month went by, without counting the walk\\r\\n  from Milwaukee to Koshkonong, lying seventy miles distant in the\\r\\n  wilderness, whither so many of the earliest Norwegian immigrants\\r\\n  were destined.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [219] The article forms one in a series of most interesting\\r\\n        articles bearing the general title \"Blandt Vestens Vikinger\"\\r\\n        (\\'Mongst the Vikings of the West) printed in _Amerika_ in\\r\\n        1901 and 1902. Dr. Teigen, son of O. C. Teigen, Koshkonong\\r\\n        Pioneer of 1846, is a poet and story writer of the first rank\\r\\n        among Norwegians in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the place of landing the immigrants were frequently obliged to\\r\\nwait for several days before the westward journey was begun. To Rock\\r\\nPrairie, Koshkonong or Norway Grove, as the case might be, required\\r\\nanother week, and correspondingly more for those bound for more\\r\\nwesterly settlements. In all the duration of the journey from Norway\\r\\nto the settlement which was the immigrant\\'s ultimate destination was\\r\\nrarely made in less than nine weeks; often it consumed as much as five\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Norwegians in Chicago, 1840-1845. A Vossing Colony.\\r\\n            Some Early Settlers in Chicago from Hardanger._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page 94 above I have spoken briefly of the first Norwegian settlers\\r\\nin Chicago in the years 1836-1839. On page 150 mention was made of the\\r\\nincrease of the Chicago colony by the arrival of a number of immigrants\\r\\nfrom Voss, Norway, in 1839-41. As there indicated, however, many of\\r\\nthose who came during these years lived there only temporarily; we find\\r\\nthem later as pioneers elsewhere, especially in Dane and La Fayette\\r\\nCounties, Wisconsin.[220] The same applies also to several of those who\\r\\ncame from Voss, Sogn, and Telemarken, to Chicago in 1843-1844;[221]\\r\\nthese went mostly to Koshkonong, Wiota or Long Prairie, others to the\\r\\nvarious parts of the Fox River settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [220] I instance the families of Th. Saue and Kvelve who went to\\r\\n        Koshkonong, and Unde, Ulven, Skjerveim and Vinje who went to\\r\\n        Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [221] For instance the Kaasa family went to Long Prairie in 1845.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chapter XXI above I have further related some incidents from the\\r\\nlife of some early Norwegian settlers in Chicago. In the following\\r\\npages I shall merely try to give a brief account of new accessions to\\r\\nthe Chicago colony between the years 1842 and 1850. It is estimated\\r\\nthat there were in Chicago in 1850 3,000 persons of Norwegian birth;\\r\\nrelatively the number was therefore considerable in that year. Yet I\\r\\nshall probably be right if I say that the actual number of Norwegians\\r\\nin the city in the year 1842 was very small, not more than in some of\\r\\nthe smallest rural settlements already established. I assume that as\\r\\nthe early Norwegian immigrants came here with the intention of settling\\r\\non a farm, comparatively very few were induced to remain permanently\\r\\nin Chicago. Chicago and vicinity was not particularly inviting at the\\r\\ntime; the swamps and marshes soon drove the incoming immigrants to the\\r\\nmore inviting and the far more fertile inland counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs residents of Chicago before 1839, we have found Halstein Torison,\\r\\nJohan Larson, Nils Röthe and wife Torbjör, Svein Knutson Lothe and\\r\\nwife and two children, Baard Johnson, wife and five children, Andrew\\r\\nNilson Brække and Anders Larsen Flage, both with families; these were\\r\\nall from Voss except Johan Larsen, a sailor who was from Kopervik,\\r\\na little south of Haugesund, and Torison, who was from Fjeldberg in\\r\\nSöndhordland.[222] Among Baard Johnson\\'s sons were Anfin, John and\\r\\nAndrew; the first of these was a tailor in the employ of Simon Doyle\\r\\non Kinzie Street.[223] The first directory of Chicago, published in\\r\\n1839, gives a few more names of Norwegians.[224] We know that Lars\\r\\nDavidson Reque lived there then; he seems to have lived in the Cass\\r\\nStreet Dutch settlement. His occupation was that of a fireman on the\\r\\nsteamboat _George W. Dole_. There were two other Davidsons, Sivert[225]\\r\\nand Peter; in the latter we recognize our Per Davidson Skjerveim (see\\r\\nabove p. 199). Other names in the same directory are: Asle Anderson,\\r\\nmusician; Endre Anderson, laborer; Eric Anderson, pressman; all three\\r\\nof whom lived at the same house on North State Street, and were\\r\\nprobably brothers; Canute Lawson (Larson), city street carpenter and\\r\\nIver Lawson, who lived at 240 Superior Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [222] The Newberry, whom Torrison worked for as a gardener was the\\r\\n        founder of well-known Newberry Library.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [223] For this and many other facts in this chapter I am indebted\\r\\n        to Strand\\'s _History_, pages 182-186.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [224] A. E. Strand published some facts from this directory on\\r\\n        pages 183-184 of his work.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [225] He was a carpenter. Mr. Strand thinks the three were\\r\\n        brothers. This is a mistake of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the directory does not give the name of another Norwegian who, if\\r\\nthe year of his arrival is correctly recorded, must have been the first\\r\\nScandinavian resident of Chicago, namely David Johnson, who came in\\r\\n1834. He was a pressman in the employ of Mr. Calhoun, the publisher\\r\\nof _The Chicago Democrat_. David Johnson was a sailor, who came from\\r\\nNorway to New York as a boy, locating in New York in 1832, securing\\r\\nwork as a press-feeder. About this time Mr. Calhoun was planning to\\r\\ninstall a cylinder press in place of the old hand press at his printing\\r\\nestablishment in Chicago. The cylinder press was ordered from New York,\\r\\nMr. Johnson having accepted Calhoun\\'s offer as pressman for him, he\\r\\nwent to Chicago at the same time, where he put up and operated the\\r\\nnew press. The Chicago Historical Society has among its documents Mr.\\r\\nCalhoun\\'s account-book for 1834, which gives Mr. Johnson\\'s name.[226]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [226] Strand\\'s _History_, p. 187.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were other Norwegians in Chicago in 1839 who do not seem to\\r\\nhave been found by the census taker. Thus Steffen K. Gilderhus came\\r\\nthere from Voss in 1838 and his brother Ole K. Gilderhus came in 1839.\\r\\nThey lived in Chicago until 1844, when they settled on Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie, Dane County, Wisconsin. Further Per Unde, Sjur Ulven and Arne\\r\\nVinje who came there in 1839; these three settled at Wiota, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin 1841. Of this removal I have given a full account above chapter.\\r\\nProbably the earliest subsequent arrival from Voss were Torstein Saue,\\r\\nwife and son Gulleik, who came in the summer of 1840. They lived in\\r\\nChicago until 1843, when they also went to Koshkonong. At about the\\r\\nsame time of the year came also Baard Nyre, Mads Sanve, Ole Gilbertson,\\r\\nBrynjulf Ronve, Klaus Grimestad and wife and Lars T. Röthe and Anna\\r\\nBakketun, all from Voss, and all of whom were for some time residents\\r\\nof Chicago. Anna Bakketun married a Mr. Nicholson (Nikolausen), who\\r\\ndied from cholera in 1849. From this marriage there were two sons,\\r\\nHenry Nicholson, who served throughout the war, and John G. Nicholson,\\r\\nwho is still living (Orchard Street). Torstein Michaelson, who\\r\\nsucceeded Halstein Torison in the employ of Newberry, also came in\\r\\n1840 or 1841. Michaelson was from Voss where he was born in 1808; he\\r\\nremained Newberry\\'s gardener for about thirty-five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have above seen that some of the early immigrants to Illinois were\\r\\nfrom Hardanger, Norway, but the number was not large. We shall speak\\r\\nof this immigration more in detail in connection with the settlement\\r\\nof Lee County, Illinois. Here it will be in order now to note briefly\\r\\nHardanger\\'s contribution to the Norwegian colony in Chicago in the\\r\\nperiod under discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1839 twenty-two persons emigrated from Ulvik Parish, Hardanger,\\r\\nand all of these came to Chicago. They were: Gunnar Tveito, wife and\\r\\nchild; Anders Vik, Johan Vik, Brynjulf Lekve, Lars Torblaa, wife\\r\\nand two children, Nils Vambheim and wife, Olav L. Mo, wife and two\\r\\ndaughters and Lars Spilde, wife and four children.[227] This party\\r\\nhaving started out from Bergen left Gothenburg May 27, landed at Fall\\r\\nRiver, Massachusetts, August 2, took boat to New York, thence via\\r\\nBuffalo to Chicago, where they arrived August 25.[228] In Chicago\\r\\nthey suffered much hardship, many were taken sick and died, among the\\r\\nlatter Tveito\\'s and Vambheim\\'s wives. The men secured work, some on\\r\\nthe canal, some on a schooner on the river, others as wood-cutters in\\r\\nthe forests about Chicago. Lekve and the two Vik brothers wrote an\\r\\naccount of their trials which was published in _Bergens Stiftstidende_\\r\\nfor June 11, 1841, in which they advised against emigrating to America,\\r\\nand as a result there was no immigration to this country from Hardanger\\r\\nagain before 1846-1847. Very few of the later immigrants from Hardanger\\r\\nlocated in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [227] Facts gathered from _Normandsforbundet_ II, where Rev.\\r\\n        O. Olofson of Ullensvang, Hardanger, discusses most\\r\\n        interestingly the early emigration from Hardanger to America\\r\\n        (pp. 169-180).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [228] The Chicago census for 1839 does not include the names of any\\r\\n        of this party.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther arrivals during subsequent years were: 1841, Peter Nelson and\\r\\nKnut Larson Bö; 1842, J. C. Anderson, and in 1843, Ole Kaasa and\\r\\nfamily, G. A. Wigeland, Nils Bakketun and Randver Lydvo (b. 1813). Ole\\r\\nKaasa moved from Chicago to Boone County, in 1845, but one of his sons,\\r\\nJens, became a permanent resident of Chicago and a leading member of\\r\\nthe Norwegian colony of Chicago during his life. Jens Olson, as he was\\r\\nknown, was born in 1824 in Siljord, Upper Telemarken. In the early part\\r\\nof 1840 the family moved to Bamble Parish in Lower Telemarken, whence\\r\\nthey emigrated in 1843. They arrived in Chicago October 20 of that\\r\\nyear. The brother, Thore Olson, went out to Boone County; Jens settled\\r\\npermanently in Chicago, where he lived till his death in 1907. In 1853\\r\\nhe married Martha Anderson[229] at Capron, Illinois.[230]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [229] She was born in 1827 at Stökebö in Levanger Parish, Diocese\\r\\n        of Bergen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [230] Mrs. Jens Olson died in 1895.\\r\\n\\r\\nJens Olson was a master mason and brick-layer, and he built Vor\\r\\nFrelsers Kirke[231] the corner of Erie and May Streets. Later he became\\r\\na contractor on a larger scale and erected a large number of school\\r\\nhouses in Chicago. He was an ardent supporter of the Lutheran church\\r\\nand gave freely to its cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [231] Our Savior\\'s Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandver Lydvo[232] came to Chicago in October, 1843. In June, 1844,\\r\\nshe was married to Lars Knutson Dykesten; the ceremony took place in\\r\\nNils Röthe\\'s house and the ceremony was performed by Rev. Flavel Bascum\\r\\nof the First Presbyterian church. Lars Knutson died in the cholera\\r\\nepidemic in 1849. Mrs. Knutson who is still living[233] is one of the\\r\\noldest Norwegian residents of Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [232] She was the daughter of Anders Knutson Lydvo and wife, Martha\\r\\n        (Röthe). Anders Lydvo died in 1860 and Martha in 1875.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [233] She resides with her daughter, Mrs. Louis H. Johnson, at 235\\r\\n        Watt Avenue, Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844 Bryngel Henderson and wife Martha came to Chicago and became\\r\\npermanent residents of the city, as did also Knut Iverson Glimme, Mrs.\\r\\nJulia Nelson, Ellef G. Severtson[234] and John A. Hefte. These were\\r\\nall from Voss; Severtson was from Vossevangen. Ole Bakketun and family\\r\\nand Sjur M. Sære, also with family, both from Voss, came to Chicago in\\r\\n1844, but lived there only one year, when they went to Koshkonong.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [234] Ellev G. Seavert.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1844 also brought Chicago another permanent resident from\\r\\nVoss, who later became prominently associated with the commercial\\r\\nand political life of the city. This was Iver Larson Bö, born 1821,\\r\\nin Voss, Norway, who came to Chicago that year and not as generally\\r\\nfound stated in or about 1840,[235] locating on the north side. Iver\\r\\ndropped the surname Bö, and changed Larson to Lawson, so that his\\r\\nname became Iver Lawson. He was one of the organizers of the First\\r\\nLutheran church in 1848, located at that time on Superior Street\\r\\nbetween Wells Street and La Salle Avenue.[236] Lawson took a prominent\\r\\npart in the political life of early Chicago, e.g., as member of the\\r\\ncity council, and otherwise. In 1869 he was a member of the House of\\r\\nRepresentatives in the State Legislature. As legislator his name is\\r\\nmost closely associated with the establishment of Chicago\\'s excellent\\r\\nsystem of parks; the creation of Lincoln Park in particular was due\\r\\nin great measure to Lawson\\'s efforts.[237] Iver Lawson\\'s name is also\\r\\nassociated with that of John Anderson in the founding of _Skandinaven_,\\r\\nnow the largest and most widely circulated Norwegian newspaper in this\\r\\ncountry.[238]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [235] So Strand, and after him Roland, p. 101.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [236] Strand, page 217.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [237] Brought out by Strand\\'s investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [238] V. F. Lawson was also the owner of _The Chicago Record_\\r\\n        before the _Record_ and the _Herald_ were combined about year\\r\\n        1898.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1845 brought a number of accessions to the Norwegian colony of\\r\\nChicago. Among them Kittil Nirison, from Bö Parish in Telemarken, one\\r\\nof the few from Telemarken who settled in Chicago in the early days,\\r\\nKnud K. Harrisville and wife Maren Karine (née Larson), Christian Lee,\\r\\nfrom Gausdal, and Andrew Anderson, wife, Laura, and family from Voss.\\r\\nThis family included a son John, born March, 1836, who is the well\\r\\nknown founder and owner of _Skandinaven_ and president of the John A.\\r\\nAnderson Publishing Company.[239]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Anderson died of the cholera in 1849, and to the son John,\\r\\nthen thirteen years old, fell the task of supporting his mother and\\r\\nbaby sister, which he did at first by peddling apples and carrying\\r\\nnewspapers. Then he became \"printer\\'s devil\" and soon learned the\\r\\nart of distributing and setting type.[240] In the following years he\\r\\nwas successively connected with _The Argus_, _The Democratic Press_\\r\\nand _The Press-Tribune_. In 1866 he launched a paper of his own,\\r\\n_Skandinaven_, which at first a small sheet issued weekly has grown\\r\\nuntil, through its daily, semi-weekly and weekly issue, it is now the\\r\\nlargest and politically the most influential of Norwegian newspapers\\r\\nin the country. Mr. Anderson has engaged extensively in the publishing\\r\\nof books, issuing a far larger number of books a year than any other\\r\\nNorwegian-American publisher. In this connection it is to be especially\\r\\nmentioned that he has also in recent years done excellent pioneer\\r\\nwork in the publishing of certain educational works, as school and\\r\\ncollege texts of Norwegian literature, thereby facilitating materially\\r\\ninstruction in this field in our colleges and universities.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [239] There were three sons, but one died at sea, and another died\\r\\n        on the journey from Albany to Buffalo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [240] Strand\\'s _History_, page 266.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn succeeding years the Norwegian colony in Chicago grew rapidly.\\r\\nAlready in 1850 it was considerable; to-day there are more Norwegians\\r\\nin Chicago than any other city in the country (see also footnote 443).\\r\\nThey resided in the early days for the most part on the north side,\\r\\nsouth of Chicago Avenue, between the lake and the present Orleans\\r\\nStreet. Later the region of Wicker Park became a Norwegian center.\\r\\nTo-day they are found very extensively in the vicinity of Humboldt Park\\r\\nand Logan Square, the business center is along West North Avenue.[241]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [241] Strand, p. 180. See also above page 50.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest Norwegian settlers of Chicago now living is to be\\r\\nmentioned finally Mrs. Martha Erickson who come to this country in\\r\\n1841. She is the daughter of Björn Björnson, who accompanied Kleng\\r\\nPeerson to America in 1825. For account of this see above page 50. The\\r\\nother twin, there referred to came to America in 1866; her name is Mrs.\\r\\nBertha Fuglestad. They are both living in Chicago enjoying excellent\\r\\nhealth at the age of eighty-eight. Björn Björnson settled in Rochester,\\r\\nNew York, where he died in 1854.[242] On their eighty-fifth birthday\\r\\nin 1906, the twin sisters held a family festival at the home of Mrs.\\r\\nEric Ross at which four children and one grandchild of Mrs. Erickson\\r\\nwere present and Mrs. Fuglestad\\'s four children, eighteen grandchildren\\r\\nand fifteen great grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [242] For above facts I am indebted to Mrs. Eric Ross of 217\\r\\n        Mozart Street, Chicago, a daughter of Mrs. Fuglestad.\\r\\n        Mrs. Erickson\\'s children: Mrs. Robert S. Carroll, Otto G.\\r\\n        Erickson, Samuel Erickson and Alex Erickson. Mrs. Fuglestad\\'s\\r\\n        children are: Mrs. Anna Ross, Thomas B. Fuglestad in Chicago,\\r\\n        Peter A. Fuglestad, Forest City, Iowa, and Mrs. Mary Jacobson\\r\\n        in Beltram, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n          _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers in the Township of\\r\\n                Pleasant Spring, Dane County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have above spoken of the fact that Knut H. Roe was one of the party\\r\\nthat emigrated with John Luraas from Tin, Telemarken, in 1839. These\\r\\ntwo men became the first Norwegians to settle in the townships of\\r\\nPleasant Spring and Dunkirk respectively in 1843. Roe had lived for a\\r\\ntime in La Salle County, Illinois, going to Racine County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin 1842, as we have seen above. In the fall of 1841 a few of the\\r\\nsettlers in Racine County had travelled west as far as Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie, for the purpose of inspecting the uninhabited country there,\\r\\nof which they seem already to have heard from friends. In the townships\\r\\nof Albion and Christiana, these met and spoke with those who had come\\r\\nthere from Jefferson Prairie in 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe favorable report of these explorers relative to the fertility\\r\\nof the soil and the general character of the country on Koshkonong\\r\\ncreated considerable restlessness among the pioneers at Wind Lake, in\\r\\nRacine County, and many decided to remove to Dane County. Among these\\r\\nwere Knut Roe and John Luraas. We shall first follow the fortunes of\\r\\nthe former. As soon as the snow was gone with the end of the winter\\r\\nof 1842-43, Roe walked on foot to Koshkonong, where he visited the\\r\\ndifferent parts of the prairie, and selected a spot on which to settle.\\r\\nThen he walked back to Racine County. John Luraas and family also\\r\\nhaving decided to remove to Dane County, the two families secured a\\r\\nteam for the overland journey; they reached their destination on one\\r\\nof the last days in May. \"Two weeks before St. John\\'s eve,\" writes\\r\\nRoe, \"my first home, a hut of brushwood and leaves, supported at the\\r\\nfour corners by an oak, was ready sufficiently so that my wife and\\r\\nchild and myself could find protection therein against rain and wind.\"\\r\\nThis he built in the southeast corner of section twenty-two in the\\r\\nTown of Pleasant Spring, at a point about two miles and a half west\\r\\nof Utica. Knut Roe, his wife, Anne, and family were the first white\\r\\nsettlers in the township. An interview with Roe which the editor of\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_ prints will therefore be of interest. He says: \"I\\r\\noften received visits by the Indians, and the many deep paths in the\\r\\nground showed that the son of the wilderness often held forth in the\\r\\nregion about me. In their marches between the Lake Koshkonong and the\\r\\nfour lakes which have made Madison famed far and wide for its beauty,\\r\\nthe Redskins often pitched camp close to my brushwood hut. Sometimes\\r\\nI accompanied them on their hunts. They never caused me any trouble,\\r\\nbut on the contrary were always ready to be helpful. There was game in\\r\\nplenty. Almost daily I saw herds of deer, flocks of prairie chickens,\\r\\nand I was often awakened at night by the howling of the wolf.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn Roe built a log cabin; in this cabin he and family\\r\\ncontinued to live till 1870. During the earliest years, he writes,\\r\\nhe was obliged to drive as far as Whitewater, thirty miles east, or\\r\\nMadison, a distance of eighteen miles, for flour. At Lake Mills,\\r\\ntwenty-two miles, there was a saw-mill. After a time the settlers began\\r\\nto sell some wheat; this had to be hauled to Milwaukee, seventy-five\\r\\nmiles away. Their only means of transportation at that time was the\\r\\n_Kubberulle_, or block-wheeled wagon, drawn by oxen, much of the way\\r\\nthrough forest, where a way had to be cut by the axe. Two weeks after\\r\\nRoe\\'s settling, Ole K. Trovatten came from Muskego and located on the\\r\\nfarm later owned by Gunder J. Felland. Trovatten, who had been a school\\r\\nteacher in Norway, had emigrated from Laurdal, Telemarken, to Muskego\\r\\nin 1840. He was, therefore, the second Norwegian to locate in Pleasant\\r\\nSpring. He, however, left for Cottage Grove that same fall. See below,\\r\\npage 252.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next arrivals were Osmund Lunde and his brother-in-law, Aslak\\r\\nKostvedt, both from Vinje in Telemarken. The latter bought land three\\r\\nmiles southeast of West Koshkonong Church, near Trovatten\\'s place.\\r\\nLunde lived at first with Kostvedt; thereupon he bought land in section\\r\\nthree. Some years later Lunde sold his farm to Kittil Rinden, oldest\\r\\nson of Kittil Rinden, Sr., and moved to Minnesota, whither Kostvedt\\r\\nalso moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third of August a small group of immigrants arrived and selected\\r\\na home and settled directly west of West Koshkonong Church, on section\\r\\nfourteen. These were Knut A. Juve,[243] his brother, Knut Gjötil\\r\\n(or Jöitil), and his sister, Tone Lien, then a widow. Juve owned an\\r\\nestate in Telemarken, which he sold upon deciding to emigrate, in May,\\r\\n1843. They sailed on the brig _Washington_, which carried eighty-six\\r\\npassengers, mostly from the parishes of Hvideseid and Laurdal.[244]\\r\\nThey landed in New York on July fourth. It was the intention of the\\r\\nmembers of this party to settle in Illinois, but in Milwaukee they were\\r\\nadvised against doing so; they were told that many who had settled in\\r\\nIllinois had later moved to Wisconsin and bought homes there. Many\\r\\nremained in Milwaukee, some went direct to Koshkonong, while others,\\r\\nincluding the Juve party, went to Wind Lake, in Racine County. Knut\\r\\nJuve was not pleased with Wind Lake. One day he met a pioneer settler\\r\\nfrom the Town of Christiana, Dane County, who, when he noticed Juve\\'s\\r\\ndowncast condition, said to him: \"Go farther west; not until you get\\r\\nto Koshkonong are you in America.\" Juve acted upon the advice; he and\\r\\nhis brother and sister started west soon after, arriving in the Town\\r\\nof Pleasant Spring, as we have said, on the third day of August. Half\\r\\na mile west of where the church was built two years later, they built\\r\\ntheir hut of brushwood, thatched with straw.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [243] Knut Juve was born in 1799. Knut Jöitil in 1803.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [244] Most of them in fair circumstances says Juve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our furniture,\" says Juve,[245] \"consisted of a few chests, that\\r\\nwere used both as table and chairs, while the bed was arranged on the\\r\\nground on some twigs and grass.\" Here they lived till October, when\\r\\nthey made a dugout, in which they lived till the following summer. Both\\r\\nJuve and Jöitil were soon, however, taken ill with the climate fever.\\r\\nIn the interview from which we have already cited, he speaks of how\\r\\nmany a time during his illness he longed back to the old home, kindred\\r\\nand friends in his native land. In the summer of 1844 a log cabin\\r\\nwas built, and not long after Jöitil and the widowed sister also had\\r\\nerected log cabins of their own in his immediate neighborhood. In the\\r\\nspring of 1844 Juve broke two acres of ground and raised a little corn\\r\\nand potatoes; the next summer he raised enough of grain and potatoes\\r\\nfor family use; the third year he was able to sell a little. Such were\\r\\nthe beginnings of agriculture in the wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [245] Interview in _Billed-Magazin_, 1870, page twenty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of August a large number came and located in the\\r\\nsettlement. Among these were Gunleik T. Sundbö (b.1785), with wife\\r\\nand three sons, two of whom were married and had families.[246]\\r\\nOthers who came were: Tostein G. Bringa (b. 1817), with wife and son,\\r\\nHalvor Laurantson Fosseim (b. 1810), and family, his brother, Ole L.\\r\\nFosseim, and Ole K. Dyrland (b. 1819).[247] Sundbö, Bringa, Fosseim\\r\\nand Dyrland all bought land not far from Knut Juve and Knut Jöitil.\\r\\nDuring the next two months the following arrived: Torbjörn G. Vik,\\r\\nwith wife and son Guttorm, and daughter Anna from Siljord, Aslak E.\\r\\nGroven (b. 1812), and family, from Laurdal, Ole E. Næset (b. 1796),\\r\\nand family, and his brother Aadne, from Vinje, and Gunnar T. Mandt,\\r\\nfrom Moe, Telemarken.[248] Groven settled about a mile east of the\\r\\nWest Koshkonong Church near the Christiana Township line; the two\\r\\nNæset brothers also located near there. This group of immigrants came\\r\\nvia Racine County, where they had remained a few weeks resting after\\r\\nthe journey, as the guests of Even Heg. They arrived on Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie in the latter part of September, having walked from Muskego.\\r\\nGunnar Mandt first came to Pleasant Spring, but as he did not have\\r\\nanything[249] with which to buy land, as he says, he worked for\\r\\nothers there and elsewhere for five years. From his autobiographical\\r\\nsketch[250] I cite the following account of the method of threshing in\\r\\nthose days:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"There were no mowers, no reapers, binders or threshing machines,\\r\\n  everything had to be done by hand. When we were to thrash, the\\r\\n  sheaves of wheat or oats were placed on the ground in a large\\r\\n  circle. Then three or four yoke of oxen were tied together with\\r\\n  an iron chain; one man stood in the center of the circle on the\\r\\n  sheaves of grain and drove the oxen around over the grain. These\\r\\n  would then stamp the kernels out of the straw little by little, and\\r\\n  so we kept on, until we had the sheaves replaced by new ones and\\r\\n  got the straw away. For cleansing the grain thus secured, we used\\r\\n  short basins or bowls such as were made in Norway formerly. After\\r\\n  a while we got a kind of fanning-mill, mower, reaper, etc. But\\r\\n  they were imperfect and cannot be compared with the machines and\\r\\n  implements used nowadays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [246] Torkild Sundbö and wife, Margit, later moved to Sun Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [247] Dyrland says there were 211 immigrants on the ship on which\\r\\n        he came, and most of these, it seems, were from Telemarken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [248] His brother, also named Gunnar, came to America in 1848; T.\\r\\n        G. Mandt, inventor of the Stoughton wagon, was a son of the\\r\\n        latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [249] Endre Vraa paid his passage to America.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [250] Published in _Amerika_ and _Skandinaven_ in January, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunnar Mandt worked in Chicago during the years 1844-45, where he got\\r\\nseventy-five cents a day, but had to furnish his own keep. In 1846\\r\\nhe returned to Pleasant Spring; in April, 1848, he married Synneva\\r\\nOlsdatter Husebö, from Systrond, Sogn, who had come to America with\\r\\nher parents in 1844. Having secured his own farm (on section nine) he\\r\\nfarmed there until 1875, when he moved to the village of Stoughton.\\r\\nGunnar Mandt died in December, 1907, his wife having died a month\\r\\nearlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of nine sections (13-15 and 22-27) in this part of the\\r\\nTownship of Pleasant Spring, was settled before the winter of 1843-44.\\r\\nKnut Roe says that, while he was alone there when he came in June, he\\r\\nhad neighbors on all sides before winter came, although the distance\\r\\nbetween the pioneer cabins was, of course, considerable. The year 1844\\r\\nbrought a large influx of settlers, chiefly from Telemarken, but in\\r\\npart also from Voss. Among them I shall here speak only of Hendrik Hæve\\r\\nand family, from Voss, who located somewhat farther north, on section\\r\\none, on the property later owned and occupied by his oldest son, Ole\\r\\nHæve (Havey); Anfin O. Holtan and family from Sogn, who settled in the\\r\\nsoutheastern part of the town on section thirty-six, where the son,\\r\\nOle Holtan, later lived; and Ole Iverson and his wife Angeline and son\\r\\nLewis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few others, as Aanund O. Drotning, from Vinje, and Knut H.\\r\\nTeisberg, from Laurdal, Telemarken, who came to America in 1843, but\\r\\nthey, too, settled elsewhere first; we shall have occasion to speak\\r\\nof them again. Finally, relative to Knut Roe, I may add that he and\\r\\nhis wife continued to live on the old homestead till their death; he\\r\\ndied as early as 1874, but she lived till 1908, being then a little\\r\\nover ninety years of age. The homestead was owned by the oldest son,\\r\\nHelleik. On the occasion of Mrs. K. Roe\\'s ninetieth birthday, all her\\r\\nchildren, eight grandchildren and twenty-five great-grandchildren,\\r\\ngathered at the old home to commemorate the event.[251]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now turn to Dunkirk Township, the earliest settling of which\\r\\nalso dates from 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [251] Ole K. Roe of Stoughton, is a son of K. Roe; other children\\r\\n        are: Mrs. F. Johnson, Mrs. Ole Thorsen, Mrs. O. Swerig and\\r\\n        Mrs. J. King. Since the above was written I have learned that\\r\\n        Helleik Roe has died (April, 1909).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The First Norwegian Settlers in the Townships of\\r\\n                  Dunkirk, Dunn, and Cottage Grove, in\\r\\n                        Dane County, Wisconsin._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settler in the Town of Dunkirk was John Nelson\\r\\nLuraas. Together with Helge Grimsrud he had explored Dunkirk and\\r\\nsurrounding country in the fall of 1842 and selected a site on which\\r\\nto settle. His father, Nils Johnson Luraas (b. 1789), arrived from\\r\\nNorway in June, 1843, and came with his son direct from Muskego to\\r\\nKoshkonong, where the party arrived on June sixteenth. An American by\\r\\nthe name of John Wheeler had settled in the town two weeks earlier,\\r\\nbeing the only white man there.[252] Luraas settled on section three,\\r\\nabout two miles east of the present city of Stoughton, and three miles\\r\\nsouth of where his companion, Knut Roe, located in the Town of Pleasant\\r\\nSpring. Only about a week after Luraas\\'s arrival, two more families,\\r\\nwho also came from Muskego, arrived and settled there, namely, Helge\\r\\nSivertson Grimsrud, wife Birgitte, son Sigurd, and Hans P. Tverberg and\\r\\nwife Ingeborg, and John P. Tverberg. The former had emigrated from\\r\\nNorway (via Drammen and Gothenburg) the year before, while Tverberg had\\r\\ncome in 1841. They were all from Tin, in Telemarken. Helge Grimsrud\\r\\npossessed considerable means in Norway and owned a fine estate, which\\r\\nhe sold upon emigrating. Grimsrud bought land in section two, directly\\r\\neast of Luraas, while Tverberg settled a mile south of Luraas in\\r\\nsection ten.[253] The next settler was Gaute Ingbrigtson Gulliksrud\\r\\n(b. 1815), from Tin, Telemarken, who arrived there five weeks later,\\r\\nthat is, in August.[254] He came in a party of about one hundred and\\r\\ntwenty persons, mostly from Telemarken, embarking at Skien, and sailed\\r\\nvia Havre de Grace to New York. Most of the party went temporarily to\\r\\nMuskego. Gulliksrud did not like Muskego, and soon after set out for\\r\\nKoshkonong. Having selected a location for his home, he bought, for\\r\\n$200, a hundred and sixty acres of land, near his countrymen, chiefly\\r\\nin section ten, and erected his log cabin a short distance north of\\r\\nHans Tverberg\\'s home.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [252] Herein I accept the authority of _Billed-Magazin_. _The\\r\\n        History of Dane County_, however, says that John Luraas was\\r\\n        the first white settler in the town, Chauncey Isham and John\\r\\n        Wheeler coming soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [253] Helge Grimsrud\\'s wife\\'s parents and a sister had emigrated\\r\\n        in 1841 and located in Muskego. Upon returning to Muskego\\r\\n        from Koshkonong in the fall of 1842, Grimsrud went direct to\\r\\n        Milwaukee and bought 240 acres of land, being the first to\\r\\n        purchase land in Dunkirk. He died in 1856.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [254] Two of his maternal uncles and a brother had emigrated in\\r\\n        1839 and located in Muskego; letters from these induced them\\r\\n        to emigrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were then in the fall of 1843 four Norwegian families settled in\\r\\nthe Town of Dunkirk. In the following year a considerable number of\\r\\nimmigrants came from Norway (Telemarken, Voss, and Sogn) but Dunkirk\\r\\ndid not receive many of those who came that year; they settled mostly\\r\\nin Christiana or Pleasant Spring, while some now began to find homes in\\r\\nCottage Grove and Dunn, immediately north and west of Pleasant Spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settlers in the Town of Dunn were Nils Ellefson\\r\\nMastre and Lars Mastre, who had come to America in 1845; they located\\r\\nin Dunn, just across the Pleasant Spring line soon after arriving;\\r\\nAmerican families had settled in the township before them. Ingebrigt\\r\\nJohnson Helle, from Kragerö, was the next settler there, but he didn\\'t\\r\\nenter Dunn until 1849; he emigrated in 1845 but had worked in Buffalo\\r\\nfour years.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn O. Hougen, from Solör, Norway, was the first Norwegian to settle\\r\\nin Cottage Grove, where he came in the summer of 1842, consequently a\\r\\nyear before Roe and others came to Pleasant Spring. Hougen had been\\r\\na baker in Christiana and usually went by the name of John Baker (or\\r\\nBager). Some years later he removed to Coon Prairie, in Vernon County,\\r\\nWisconsin. Björn Tovsen Vasberg, from Laurdal, Telemarken, also located\\r\\nin Cottage Grove in the summer of 1842. Nothing seems to be known of\\r\\nhis antecedents, and little that is favorable seems to be known of him\\r\\nduring his brief career in the township. He later moved to Minnesota,\\r\\nwhere he lived, it seems, a roving life, being at last found dead on\\r\\nthe public highway. He was a notorious, and as far as I know, the only\\r\\ninstance of the vagabond and ne\\'er-do-well among the Norwegian pioneers\\r\\nof those days. The next Norwegian settler in the Town of Cottage Grove\\r\\nwas Halvor Kostvedt,[255] from Vinje Parish, who emigrated in the\\r\\nspring of 1842; he lived for a year in Christiana Township, and came\\r\\nto Cottage Grove in the summer of 1843 and made a dugout on section\\r\\ntwenty-four, in which he lived the first year. Others who came on the\\r\\nsame ship were Alexander O. Bækhus (or Norman), Ole A. Haatvedt and\\r\\nOsmund Lunde. The first of these located in Christiana, but later moved\\r\\nto Minnesota; Ole Haatvedt settled on Jefferson Prairie, whence some\\r\\nyears later he went to Iowa, while Asmund Lunde, after remaining a year\\r\\nin Muskego, came to Pleasant Spring, as we have seen, in the summer of\\r\\n1843. Ole Trovatten, whom we have already met, both in Muskego and in\\r\\nPleasant Spring, came to Cottage Grove in the fall of 1843. Trovatten\\r\\nis reputed to have been a man of unusual natural gifts and considerable\\r\\neloquence. He served as deacon in West Koshkonong and Liberty Prairie\\r\\nchurches for many years, a capacity in which he had officiated also\\r\\nin Norway. He later affiliated with the East Koshkonong Church, which\\r\\ncongregation he, with O. P. Selseng, represented on the occasion of the\\r\\nfounding of the Norwegian Synod in East Koshkonong Church, on February\\r\\n5th, 1853.[256]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [255] Called also Halvor i Vinje.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [256] Page 15 of _Kort Uddrag of den norske Synodes Historie_, by\\r\\n        Rev. Jacob Aal Ottesen, Decorah, 1893.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsmund Aslakson Næstestu, with wife and family, came to Muskego in\\r\\nthe fall of 1843, where he worked as a blacksmith for six months. He\\r\\nremoved to Koshkonong early the next spring, going direct to Halvor\\r\\nKostvedt, with whom he lived in the dugout the first summer. In 1847 he\\r\\nbought land in the same locality. Næstestu[257] is said to have been\\r\\nfamed in Norway as a mechanical genius of rare talent. On one occasion\\r\\nKing Carl Johan was shown a gun made by the farmer\\'s son in Vinje; the\\r\\nKing afterwards sent Asmund Næstestu a silver cup as a token of his\\r\\npleasure over the excellent workmanship of the gun. Asmund Næstestu\\r\\nbought a farm a mile and a half northwest of Nora Post Office in 1854,\\r\\nwhere he, in the course of time, became the owner of two hundred acres.\\r\\nAmong others who came to America with Asmund Næstestu in 1843 and later\\r\\nsettled in Cottage Grove, were Næstestu\\'s nephews, Aslak and Halvor\\r\\nOlson Bækhus (or Gjergjord as they called themselves in this country),\\r\\nBjörn O. Hustvedt, Halvor Donstad and Knut Teisberg.[258]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [257] Asmund Næstestu was the son of Aslak Næstestu, a man of much\\r\\n        native ability and influence in Vinje. Anna Næstestu, a\\r\\n        daughter of Aslak, married Ole Bækhus; they were the parents\\r\\n        of the Bækhus (Gjergjord) brothers of whom we shall speak in\\r\\n        the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally I shall add the names of Björn A. Stondall and Björn\\r\\nStevens Hustvedt, two of Cottage Grove\\'s well known early pioneers,\\r\\nwho emigrated in 1843 and stopped through the winter in Muskego;\\r\\nthence they came to Koshkonong, locating in Cottage Grove in the\\r\\nspring of 1844.[259] Björn Stondal was from Vinje, in Telemarken,\\r\\nbeing born on the farm Næstestu in Bögrænd in 1823. He sailed on\\r\\nthe ship _Vinterflid_ from Porsgrund in the spring of 1843, as he\\r\\nrelates.[260] They were eleven weeks on the ocean before reaching New\\r\\nYork. The objective point was Milwaukee and the Muskego settlement;\\r\\nhere they stopped during the winter with an American by the name of\\r\\nPutnam,--seven persons in a hut that was fourteen feet long and ten\\r\\nfeet wide. In the spring of 1844 he walked west to Koshkonong, where he\\r\\ndecided to buy eighty acres of land in section thirty-two in southern\\r\\nCottage Grove, and begin the occupation of a farmer. Four years later\\r\\nhe married Gunhild Bergland. Björn Stondal died in April, 1906, at the\\r\\nage of eighty-three, survived by his wife and nine children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [258] They came in the same ship as Knut Jöitil and Anund Drotning,\\r\\n        who, as we have seen, located in Pleasant Spring. Knut\\r\\n        Teisberg moved from Cottage Grove to Pleasant Spring in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [259] Hustvedt wrote his name Ben Stevens.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [260] According to interview printed in _Amerika_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Expansion of the Koshkonong Settlement into\\r\\n               Sumner and Oakland Townships in Jefferson\\r\\n             County. Increased Immigration from Telemarken.\\r\\n                       New Settlers from Kragerö,\\r\\n                         Drammen and Numedal._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our discussion of the settling of Koshkonong by immigrants from\\r\\nNumedal in 1840-42, mention was made of Tore Knudson Nore and wife\\r\\nGjertud among those who arrived in 1842. Tore Nore did not, however,\\r\\nlocate in Christiana or Albion townships, where his compatriots had\\r\\nsettled. He selected land about three miles southeast of where Gunnul\\r\\nVindeig had located, across the Jefferson County line in what later was\\r\\nnamed Sumner Township. Tore Nore, who was then a man of about forty\\r\\nyears of age and had a large family, had emigrated in the spring of\\r\\n1842, but had not, as the immigrants from Numedal so far had generally\\r\\ndone, gone to Jefferson Prairie or Rock Prairie, but had stopped in\\r\\nMuskego. Being dissatisfied here, he decided to go to Koshkonong.\\r\\nTaking his family with him, he arrived there about October first\\r\\nof that year. Soon after he erected his log cabin in Sumner,[261]\\r\\nbeing, therefore, the first Norwegian to settle in that part of\\r\\nJefferson County, his being the second family to enter the township\\r\\nof Sumner.[262] Here he lived till his death in 1868, at the age of\\r\\nseventy-six. Gjertrud Nore died in 1884. Three sons are prosperous\\r\\nfarmers living in the neighborhood of the father\\'s original homestead.\\r\\nA daughter, Gro, married Peder Larsen Svartskuren (or Svartskor) in\\r\\nNorway, in June, 1842. They became the second Norwegian family to\\r\\nsettle in the township. Peder Svartskuren was a native of Konigsberg,\\r\\nNorway, being, as it appears, the third emigrant to America from that\\r\\nlocality.[263]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [261] This log-cabin was still standing not many years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [262] An American family had come there before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [263] The first emigrants from Kongsberg were Thomas Braaten, and\\r\\n        Halvor Funkelien.\\r\\nIn an interview with Svein Nilson printed in 1870, Peder Svartskuren\\r\\nmentions Björn Anderson (Kvelve), Amund Hornefjeld, Gunnul Vindeig and\\r\\nThorsten Olson as being the only Norwegians living in the neighboring\\r\\ntowns of Albion and Christiana when he came there. He speaks of Sumner\\r\\nTownship as being a heavy primeval forest, with only here and there a\\r\\nstretch of open country. \"There was an abundance of game, deers and\\r\\nprairie chickens, and the lake (Koshkonong) and creek were full of\\r\\nfish. The Indians were roving about the country, but they did no one\\r\\nany harm and were kindly and ever ready to help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Svartskuren, who is now eighty-seven years old and quite feeble,\\r\\nhas, since 1902, lived at Leeds, North Dakota, with a son, Carl,\\r\\nhe having sold the homestead after the father\\'s death, and moved to\\r\\nViroqua, Wisconsin, and later to Leeds. Peder Svartskuren was among\\r\\nthe founders of the East Koshkonong Church; he was a man of strong\\r\\ncharacter, who enjoyed in large degree the love and the respect of his\\r\\nfellows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Sumner did not receive many accessions from Norway. In\\r\\nthe same interview Svartskuren says: \"There are now twelve Norwegian\\r\\nfamilies, besides six Swedish families. The rest are German and\\r\\nEnglish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Oakland, Jefferson County, also received a few settlers at\\r\\nthis early period. The earliest arrival there was, I believe, Tollef\\r\\nBækhus and wife, Aasild; they came to Koshkonong in 1843 and located\\r\\ntwo miles east of the village of Rockdale. They were from Laurdal\\r\\nParish, in Upper Telemarken, had been married in 1838, and had two\\r\\nchildren when they came to this country. Tollef Bækhus died in 1897,\\r\\nthe widow lived until 1906, being ninety years old at the time of her\\r\\ndeath. A son, John Bækhus, now owns the homestead.[264]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [264] They had twelve children in all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XVIII above we gave an account of the founding of the\\r\\nKoshkonong Settlement, which began in the townships of Christiana,\\r\\nDeerfield and Albion, in 1840-41. We spoke briefly of the founders and\\r\\nof those who came and joined the three groups of pathfinders in the\\r\\nfollowing year. In Chapter XXVIII a similar record has been given of\\r\\nthe events which led to the settling of the Town of Pleasant Spring by\\r\\nfour families in 1843, and by others in the following year. We have\\r\\nalso observed how the towns of Dunkirk and Cottage Grove became settled\\r\\nin 1843, and that Dunn received its first Norwegian settlers in 1844.\\r\\nThe towns of Sumner and Oakland, in Jefferson County, in the eastern\\r\\nextremity of Koshkonong Prairie also received a small contingent\\r\\nof Norwegian immigrant settlers in 1842 and 1843 respectively. The\\r\\noriginal nucleus and the subsequent expansions of the settlement, east,\\r\\nwest and north, are thereby indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn four years after its inception, the settlement covered an area\\r\\nof about fifteen square miles. But the settlers lived, for the most\\r\\npart, far apart; geographically they had made ample provisions for a\\r\\ngreat settlement in this garden spot of Wisconsin. While there were\\r\\nas yet (in 1843) not more than a hundred and fifty individuals in the\\r\\nsettlement, there was room for thousands more without going beyond\\r\\nthe boundary as already laid out. The beginning made in a few years\\r\\nwas remarkable, but the growth in the years immediately following was\\r\\neven more wonderful. For a time Koshkonong was the destination of\\r\\nfour-fifths of those who emigrated from Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1842 records the beginning of the great development, which\\r\\nin five years resulted in the settling of almost the whole of this\\r\\nvast area by immigrants from Norway. The next year was that of the\\r\\ngreat influx from various points in Telemarken, especially, Siljord,\\r\\nLaurdal and Hvideseid, although there were considerable numbers also\\r\\nfrom Vinje and Tin. The year 1843 was the one in which the Telemarkings\\r\\ntook possession of Koshkonong; they gradually selected their permanent\\r\\nhomes in Pleasant Spring, extending into Dunkirk and Cottage Grove and\\r\\nthe northeastern sections of Christiana (as Eggleson, Bjoin, Hauge,\\r\\nBorgerud, Bosbön and Kingland). The Numedalians came only in limited\\r\\nnumbers after 1842 and did not spread much beyond the original center\\r\\naround East Koshkonong church in southeastern Christiana and northern\\r\\nAlbion townships. Those on the extreme west were Levi Kittilson, Levi\\r\\nHoltan, O. O. Lenaas and Tore E. Smithback, all coming somewhat later\\r\\nthan those in the eastern extremity. The immigration from Numedal,\\r\\nwhich began in Rollaug, is after 1842 almost confined to Flesberg, a\\r\\nparish which furnished no immigrants before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1843, there came to Koshkonong, 35 families and many single\\r\\npersons, or a total of 182 individuals. This was the year of heaviest\\r\\nimmigration to Koshkonong. The year\\'s influx is significant in the\\r\\nlarge number of districts in Norway represented, Telemarken leading\\r\\nas has been pointed out above. In addition to 9 persons from Numedal,\\r\\nand a small contingent from Voss, the first party of fourteen persons\\r\\narrived from Kragerö. These first immigrants from Kragerö were: Bjorn\\r\\nO. Rom, Kjöstolf Tollefsen Hulderöen[265] (b. 1821), Even E. Buaas (b.\\r\\n1799), Abraham K. Rönningen, Erick K. Rönningen, Halvor E. Dahl (b.\\r\\n1802), wife Anne, and family, Torbjörn K. Rönningen, Glus P. Tyvang and\\r\\nwife, Audi, and Peder K. Rönningen. From Leikanger in Sogn[266] Anna L.\\r\\nEggum (or Eggene, b. 1811), who in 1845 married Sjur C. Droksvold, from\\r\\nVoss; from Lier came Knut O. Lier, as also the widow Anne Thorstad,\\r\\nKnut Asdöhldalen and Gabriel Björnson (from Drammen); from Drangedal\\r\\ncame Baruld J. Strandskougen and family, from Sandsværd, Ellef A. Berg,\\r\\nfrom Skauger, Halvor J. Stubberud, from Rögen, Lars P. Haukelien and\\r\\nfamily, from Holte, Tarald E. Midböe, from Gjerpen, Peder H. Moe, and\\r\\nfrom Hallingdal, Even Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [265] Came to Muskego in 1843, went back to Norway and returned,\\r\\n        settling in Koshkonong in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [266] There was one immigrant from Aurland, Sogn, in 1843, but he\\r\\n        stopped the first winter in Muskego. See next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have noted the fact above that there came for the first time in\\r\\n1843 a group of immigrants from Flesberg Parish in Numedal. We shall\\r\\nnote here briefly who these were. For the facts I am indebted to Mrs.\\r\\nLevi Holtan, formerly of Utica, at present of Stoughton, Wisconsin.\\r\\nThe name of the ship on which these people came, Mrs. Holtan cannot\\r\\nremember, but it was commanded by Captain Overvind; the first mate\\r\\nwas Friis. In the party of ninety persons were: Halvor Kjölen, Juul\\r\\nHamre and wife Anne, Tostein Ullebær and Halvor Aasen, who went to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie,[267] Gulleik Laugen, who stopped in Rochester, but\\r\\nsoon after came west, locating on Rock Prairie, Paal (\"Spelleman\")\\r\\nLund, Guldbrand G. Holtan, a widower, his brother Ole G. Holtan,[268]\\r\\nKnut K. Bakli and Kittil G. Bakli and families, Ambjör Olsdatter and\\r\\nSynnöve Kristoffersdatter Bekkjorden from Lyngdal Annex of Flesberg.\\r\\nThis was the ship on which also Per Svartskuren and wife Gro, Knut\\r\\nLier and Baruld Johnson came on.[269] In the same party emigrated also\\r\\nKlemet Larson Stalsbraaten and wife Gunild, and his brother Halvor\\r\\nStalsbraaten (Kravik) from Sigdal in Numedal. Halvor Stalsbraaten took\\r\\nthe name Kravik from the estate where he had worked five years before\\r\\nemigrating. Reverend Kasberg writes me, citing Halvor Kravik, that they\\r\\n(the Stalsbraatens)\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Bought tickets for America at Konigsberg Fair, left Drammen May\\r\\n  6 ult., 1843, arrived at New York July fourth, ninety passengers\\r\\n  on the ship.\" ... \"The company of immigrants went from Milwaukee\\r\\n  to Muskego. Halvor Kravik and a young boy from Sandsværd walked to\\r\\n  Koshkonong, arriving Friday evening. Monday morning Halvor was at\\r\\n  work for one of the Englishmen further south. Kravik took a claim\\r\\n  in 1844. During the winter he staid with Gunnul Vindeg, sleeping\\r\\n  in the part of the house occupied at the time by Rev. Dietrichson,\\r\\n  while the parsonage was being built.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [267] Rev. K. A. Kasberg, of Spring Grove, Minn., writes me that\\r\\n        Halvor Kravik in speaking of some of these people says Halvor\\r\\n        Aasen went to Rock Run as did also Paal \"Spellemand.\" He also\\r\\n        adds the name Gunnar Springen who, he says, went to Rock\\r\\n        Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [268] As I learn through Rev. G. A. Larsen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [269] The name of the ship, as we learn elsewhere, was _Hercules_.\\r\\n        See above page 228.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the party also came to Koshkonong a short while after,\\r\\nexcept those who went to Rock County. Ole G. Holtan (b. 1821) and\\r\\nAmbjör Olsdatter (b. 1821) were married a few weeks after arriving;\\r\\nOle Holtan died in 1851, leaving wife and two children, Anna and Ole.\\r\\nAnna later became the wife of Levor Kittilsen Fjöse (Levi Kittilsen)\\r\\nwell known farmer and prominent in the councils of the West Koshkonong\\r\\nChurch.[270] Ambjör, widow of Ole G. Holtan, married Nils Torgerson\\r\\nGrötrud in 1852; he had come to America in 1849.[271]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [270] Levi Kittilsen died suddenly in 1907; the widow is living (at\\r\\n        Stoughton); a daughter, Andrea, is married to Rev. Abel Lien,\\r\\n        Ada, Minn.; a son, Carl, is in Nome, Alaska. Dr. Albert N.\\r\\n        Kittilsen, another son, owns valuable mines at Nome, Alaska;\\r\\n        he is living in the State of Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [271] Nils Grötrud assumed the farm name Holtan and is therefore\\r\\n        Nils T. Holtan. He located first on the Holtan farm south of\\r\\n        Utica. About 1868 the family settled two miles east of Utica.\\r\\nWe have, on page 183 above, spoken of Lars J. Holo, who was the\\r\\nearliest immigrant from Ringsaker (1839). From Rochester, New York,\\r\\nhe came to Muskego, Racine County, Wisconsin, in 1841; in 1843 he\\r\\nlocated permanently on Koshkonong. His son Johannes also settled on\\r\\nKoshkonong, as also the sons Lars and Martin Holo. The latter now owns\\r\\nthe farm originally purchased in Albion Township by Björn Kvelve.\\r\\nHalvor Kravik (b. 1820) was the son of Lars A. Stalsbraaten and wife\\r\\nMaria. In 1845 he married Kristi Guldbrandson, who had come to America\\r\\nin 1842. They bought land and settled permanently about three-quarters\\r\\nof a mile south of East Koshkonong Church at what came to be called\\r\\n_Kravikhaugen_ (the Kravik hill). The homestead has now for many years\\r\\nbeen occupied by the oldest son, Lars C. Kravik. Since about 1899,\\r\\nHalvor and his wife lived with their son-in-law, Rev. K. A. Kasberg,\\r\\nin Stoughton, Wisconsin, later in Grand Forks, North Dakota, now for\\r\\nseveral years past at Spring Grove, Houston County, Minnesota. Mrs.\\r\\nKravik died a year ago; Mr. Kravik in February, 1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nKjöstolf Hulderöen (Hulröya), who came to Muskego in 1843, went back to\\r\\nNorway two years later, but returned to America in 1846, settling on\\r\\nKoshkonong, at Cambridge. In 1848 he married Hæge O. Sube, who had come\\r\\nfrom Telemarken to this country that year. In 1853 he started a general\\r\\nmerchandise business in Rockdale, Dane County, where he lived till\\r\\nhis death in 1889. The widow is living with her oldest daughter Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Halvorson in Rockdale. A son, Charlie C. Tellefson, one of Dane\\r\\nCounty\\'s prominent democrats, resides at Utica, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGabriel Björnson was one of the few who came to Koshkonong from the\\r\\nregion of Drammen. He married Gunhild Grötrud, sister of Nils T. Holtan\\r\\n(Grötrud). Björnson is said to have been the first Norwegian to be\\r\\nadmitted to the bar in this country. He died in Ada, Minnesota, in\\r\\n1889; he was at that time County Attorney of Norman County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two families from Voss, who had immigrated earlier among\\r\\nthose who settled permanently on Koshkonong in 1843, namely Styrk\\r\\nOlson Saue, who, we have seen, came to America in 1837, and Gulleik\\r\\nTorsteinson Saue, who immigrated in 1840; they had lived most of\\r\\nthe time in Chicago. There Styrk Saue married Eli K. Væte; she\\r\\ndied at Deerfield about 1885. Styrk died in 1894. Gulleik Saue (b.\\r\\n1821) married Donant Rölje in 1844. They purchased land in northern\\r\\nChristiania, not far from Cambridge; here, and in neighboring parts of\\r\\nDeerfield Township, Gulleik Thompson, as he called himself, became in\\r\\nthe course of time the owner of about 1,000 acres of farm land. At the\\r\\ntime of his death he was Koshkonong\\'s wealthiest farmer. His son, Hon.\\r\\nT. G. Thompson, occupies the old home and owns the estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Coming of the First Large Party of Immigrants\\r\\n                 from Sogn. New Accessions from Voss._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been noted above that one of the earliest pioneers at Wiota,\\r\\nLa Fayette County, Wisconsin, was from Vik Parish in Sogn, namely,\\r\\nPer Unde who emigrated in 1839. In 1842 Ole Unde came and joined his\\r\\nbrother at Wiota. In 1843 Ole Schærdalen[272] came to America from\\r\\nAurland, Sogn; he was the first emigrant from that parish. It has been\\r\\nsaid that there was a party of immigrants from Sogn in 1843, but this\\r\\nI doubt as I have been able nowhere to verify it. Ole Schærdalen went\\r\\nto Muskego where he stopped the first year, then he joined the party\\r\\nof Sognings who came that year and passed through Muskego en route\\r\\nfor Koshkonong. Per and Ole Unde wrote letters home to Vik Parish, in\\r\\nresponse to these letters, full of praise for Wisconsin, there came\\r\\nmany immigrants from Vik during the next two years. Ole Schærdalen in a\\r\\nsimilar way aided in promoting emigration from Inner Sogn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [272] So written, but pronounced Schirdalen in the dialect. My\\r\\n        father is the authority for the statement that Schærdalen was\\r\\n        the first to emigrate from Aurland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Aurland Parish lived Ole Torjussen Flom; he had travelled much in\\r\\nNorway and come in contact with people who had relatives and friends\\r\\nin America, and who themselves were planning to emigrate. He was well\\r\\nacquainted with Schærdalen and he had been in Vik and knew, it seems,\\r\\nthe Unde family. Ole T. Flom (b. 1794) was the son of Torjus Flom (b.\\r\\nabout 1765) generally called Torjus i Midgarden, who was the owner of a\\r\\nvaluable estate at Flaam near Fretheim. There were three sons, Gulleik,\\r\\nOle, and Knut; by the right of primogeniture the estate would fall to\\r\\nthe oldest son, Gulleik Flom. Ole Flom had selected for purchase a\\r\\nplace then for sale, in Voss, and it was his intention to remove to\\r\\nVoss. He was, however, prevailed upon not to do this by his father who\\r\\ntold him he would give him half of the family estate. When, however,\\r\\nthe time came, the temptation to follow the general practice and give\\r\\nthe estate intact over to the oldest son became too strong for the\\r\\nfather and he gave it all to Gulleik Flom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle T. Flom then began thinking about emigrating to America. In 1843 he\\r\\nwent to Vik Parish and while there he and Anfin J. Seim agreed to go to\\r\\nAmerica. After he returned to Aurland others in the parish also began\\r\\nto make preparations for leaving for the New World and the fever spread\\r\\nto Fresvik and Systrond and up as far as Sogndal Parish. In the spring\\r\\nof 1844 a considerable number from these regions and from Vik stood\\r\\nready to emigrate. Ole T. Flom, wife Anna and sons Ole and Anders,\\r\\nIvar H. Vangen and Knut Aaretuen (i Aureto), wife Anna[273] and three\\r\\nchildren left Aurlandsvangen on the 12th of April. They had engaged\\r\\npassage on _Juno_, Captain Bendixen, but were obliged to wait in Bergen\\r\\ntwo weeks before sailing. In the meantime others who also were to go on\\r\\n_Juno_ joined them at Bergen. Among them were the Melaas families from\\r\\nNorum Annex of Sogndal Parish; they were the first to emigrate from\\r\\nthat district. This party was composed of the following eleven members:\\r\\nMons Lasseson Melaas (b. 1787) and wife Martha; Kristen L. Melaas,\\r\\nwife Aase and daughter Anna; Johans K. Bjelde and wife Kristi; Ole A.\\r\\nSlinde, wife Martha;[274] and two children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [273] She was a daughter of Ole Schærdalen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [274] A daughter of Mons Melaas. Their husbands took the name\\r\\n        Melaas in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following persons from various parts of Sogn also embarked on\\r\\n_Juno_: Anders Engen, Per L. Gjerde, Michel J. Engesæter and wife\\r\\nSynnöve from Systrand, Ole I. Husebö with wife Ingeleiv and children,\\r\\nand Ole A. Værken (Grinde) from Leikanger, Nils T. Seim, wife Mari and\\r\\nchildren (3) and Thomas T. Seim from Lærdal, and the aforementioned\\r\\nAnfin I. Seim from Vik with his wife Britha and five children.[275]\\r\\nThere were about sixty persons on _Juno_ when it sailed in May. At\\r\\nthe same time two other ships sailed from Bergen with immigrants\\r\\nfor America; they were _Kong Sverre_, Captain Vingaard and _Albion_,\\r\\nCaptain Brock. A very large number of those who embarked on these ships\\r\\nalso were from Sogn, especially Vik, nearly all these going to Long\\r\\nPrairie (see next chapter). Among those who came to Koshkonong were:\\r\\nTorstein Thronson Selseng and wife Kari, Knut Gjerde, Ole Selseng,\\r\\nJakob I. Gjerdene, from Sogndal, Elling O. Flatland, wife and children,\\r\\nand Sjur S. Ölman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [275] Relative to the personnel of this party and the sailing\\r\\n        of _Juno_ I am especially to Kristi Melaas, with whom I\\r\\n        have had several interviews on the question. She is the\\r\\n        oldest surviving member of the party and is still living\\r\\n        at Stoughton, Wisconsin. My father, Ole O. Flom, has also\\r\\n        supplied many facts; he was thirteen years old at the time of\\r\\n        immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ sailed three days before _Juno_, but arrived\\r\\nin New York several weeks later. _Juno_ made the journey to New York\\r\\nin five weeks and three days, which, says Kristi Melaas, broke the\\r\\nrecord for fast sailing at that time. \"The Brock ship\" took eight\\r\\nweeks for the journey, while _Kong Sverre_ was on the ocean twelve\\r\\nweeks. The party that came with _Juno_ was therefore the first large\\r\\ngroup of Sognings to land in America, the date of their landing being\\r\\nSt. John\\'s Eve. From New York they went by canal-boat to Buffalo,\\r\\nwhere they arrived on the fourth of July. Here they were put on board\\r\\nan old steamboat, which the immigrants feared would go to the bottom\\r\\nat any moment of the journey, says Mrs. Melaas, over the lakes to\\r\\nMilwaukee, where they arrived at the end of July.[276] Kristi Melaas\\r\\nsays the agent weighed their goods at every stopping place and charged\\r\\ntoll each time. There was no interpreter on the boat who could voice\\r\\ntheir objections. The ticket from New York to Chicago was $14, but by\\r\\nadditional charges along the route, the expense of the inland journey\\r\\nwas greater than that from Bergen to New York. In Milwaukee most of the\\r\\nparty, including Ole Vendelbo, Ole T. Flom, Knut Aaretuen and Michel\\r\\nEngesæter went to Koshkonong via Muskego, but the Melaas family went\\r\\nto Chicago, as did Ole Husebö and one man from Vik who had intended to\\r\\ngo south to Missouri,[277] and they were all met in Chicago by one who\\r\\nwas to bring them to Missouri. It seems, however, that the departure\\r\\nhither was delayed for weeks by their guide who was addicted to drink.\\r\\nIn the meantime the Melaas families becoming discouraged and having\\r\\nmet a certain Ole Bringa who urged them to come to Koshkonong, decided\\r\\nto go where the rest of the party had already directed their course.\\r\\nThey then bought two yoke of oxen and drove to Koshkonong, stopping in\\r\\nPleasant Spring Township about two miles northeast of Lake Kegonsa.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [276] Kristi Melaas called the boat \"_ein rota baot skikke-leg_.\"\\r\\n        She says the agent who had charge of the journey to Milwaukee\\r\\n        was a man by the name of Hohlfelt, a typical immigrant\\r\\n        \"runner,\" it seems, whom she styles as \"ain rigele bedragar,\\r\\n        ain stakkars Mann va han.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [277] This man we learn was Anfin Seim (see next chapter).\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after arriving at Koshkonong they were met by Ole Trovatten\\r\\nwho aided them in the selection of land and who accompanied Johans\\r\\nand Ole Melaas to Milwaukee to purchase the land selected. The two\\r\\nbrothers bought each forty acres at first in section three; later\\r\\nJohans bought out Ole and eighty acres more adjacent to the acquired\\r\\nforty. Ole A. Melaas thereupon located on section thirty-five in\\r\\nCottage Grove Township, a mile northeast of his brother\\'s property.\\r\\nThe Melaas families all located in that immediate neighborhood. Ole\\r\\nT. Flom bought eighty acres in Cottage Grove Township, a mile north\\r\\nof Door Creek where also Ole Vendelbo Olson settled, purchasing forty\\r\\nacres. Olson, however, sold this out to Ole T. Flom not long after,\\r\\nand moved to Minnesota. Nile Seim also located near there, while Per\\r\\nGjerde settled in section two in Pleasant Spring, near the Cottage\\r\\nGrove line. Ole I. Husebö settled in Christiana Township and Sjur Ölman\\r\\nsettled a mile north of Nora Post-office. Ivar Vangen located on Bonnet\\r\\nPrairie, Michel Engesæter lived a few years on Koshkonong, then removed\\r\\nto Norway Grove. Knut Aaretuen settled in Koshkonong, but went west\\r\\n(to Minnesota) after some years. Anfin Seim, who was from Vik, went\\r\\nwith the Melaas families to Chicago, and thence to Long Prairie, Boone\\r\\nCounty, Illinois (see next chapter). The only family from Vik to locate\\r\\nin Koshkonong that year was that of Mons Halringa, who settled in\\r\\nPleasant Spring, a mile or so southwest of Utica; the homestead being\\r\\nthat later occupied by his son Simon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigration to Koshkonong in 1844 was thus principally from Sogn,\\r\\nand it is to be noted that a considerable number of these settled in\\r\\nthe northern extremity of the settlement, north of Door Creek and\\r\\nNora. At the same time there were new accessions from other districts,\\r\\nespecially Voss and Laurdal in Telemarken, while from Rollaug came\\r\\nthat year Gisle H. Venaas and Anfin A. Haugerud. Among those who came\\r\\nfrom Voss I shall name here the brothers Nils and Sjur Droksvold, Ole\\r\\nDroksvold, Henrik O. Hæve, Erik V. Rio (Williams), Erik S. Fliseram,\\r\\nand Knut E. Rokne; all these had families.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong earlier immigrants from Voss who located in Dane County in 1844\\r\\nwere Ole and Steffen Gilderhus; the former had immigrated in 1839 while\\r\\nSteffen came in 1838. As has been observed above, Lars D. Rekve, who\\r\\ncame to America in 1839, did not actually settle in Koshkonong until\\r\\n1844. Rokne and Venaas settled in Christiana, the former three miles\\r\\nwest of Cambridge, the latter two miles northwest of Rockdale. Most of\\r\\nthe Vossings, however, located in Deerfield Township, south and west of\\r\\nthe village of Deerfield. We shall now turn to the immigrants who came\\r\\nfrom Sogn with _Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ in 1844 and did not settle in\\r\\nWisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Long Prairie in Boone County, Illinois; a Sogning\\r\\n                              Settlement._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vicinity of the present village of Capron, Illinois, a few\\r\\nNorwegians located in 1843, forming the nucleus of what later came to\\r\\nbe known as Long Prairie. This settlement is located only a few miles\\r\\nsouth of Jefferson Prairie (which extends into Illinois) and is about\\r\\nsixty-five miles distant west from Chicago. The earliest Norwegian\\r\\nsettlers here were Thor Olson Kaasa and Thov Knutson Traim, his wife\\r\\nIngebjorg and sons, Knut, Kjetil, and Ole, from Siljord in Upper\\r\\nTelemarken. Thor Kaasa was the son of Ole Kaasa and wife Margit, who\\r\\nimmigrated in 1843 with a family of nine children, of whom Thor was the\\r\\noldest. We have spoken of their coming on page 235. Among the other\\r\\nchildren the sons, Gjermund, Jens, Jörgen, and Kittel, and daughters,\\r\\nGuro, Aase, Emelie and Kristense, also moved to the settlement in 1845.\\r\\nBoth Ole Kaasa and his wife died of cholera in 1854; Jörgen Kaasa\\r\\nsettled in Winneshiek County in 1852, while Thor Kaasa moved to Filmore\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota; Jens located permanently in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844 there came five persons from Siljord, Norway, namely Björn\\r\\nBrekketo[278] and wife Guro, her brothers Jens and Steinar, and\\r\\nJohannes Kleiva. Björn Brekketo died early and the widow married Ole\\r\\nOreflaat. Not many more immigrants from Telemarken located at Capron.\\r\\nIn 1844-45 natives of Sogn took possession of Long Prairie, and the\\r\\nsettlement has ever since remained preëminently a Sogning settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [278] Knut Brekketo, a son of Björn Brekketo, is living at Capron\\r\\n        at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have observed above that of those who came from Sogn on the ship\\r\\n_Juno_ in 1844, Anfin Seim and family did not locate in Koshkonong, but\\r\\nwent to Boone County, Illinois; they were the only ones of _Juno\\'s_\\r\\npassengers to settle in Illinois. On the other hand a considerable\\r\\nnumber of those who came on _Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ located at Long\\r\\nPrairie. Among them were the following who came with the _Albion_:\\r\\nOle J. Aavri, wife Britha and daughter Inga and sons Johans and\\r\\nAndres.[279] Ivar S. Rislauv and wife Eli, a daughter of Ole Aavri;\\r\\nLars Johnson Haave, wife Randi, daughter Britha, and two sons Joe\\r\\n(John) and Ole; Andrew Olson Stadhem (Staim), wife Sigrid, two sons and\\r\\nfour daughters, Olina, Britha, Aase, and Inga; Ole Stadhem and family;\\r\\nIvar I. Haave, wife Barbro and sons Ingebrigt and Elling; Endre H.\\r\\nNumedal and wife Helga, daughter of Ivar Haave; Ole Berdahl and family;\\r\\nIngebrigt N. Vange, wife Britha, and three daughters, and Ole Vange.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [279] Andres Aavri soon after returned to Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the _Sverre_ came: Anders H. Numedal and wife Aagot, Ole Tistele,\\r\\nOle O. Tenold and wife Sigri, Ole P. Tenold, Ole J. Orvedal, wife\\r\\nRagnilda, and three daughters,[280] Lars O. Fölie, Joe Fölie, who died\\r\\nof cholera in Chicago, Ivar Fölie, Lars Jensen Haave, with family and\\r\\nIngebrigt J. Fuglegjærdet. Besides these there were on both ships a\\r\\nnumber of young unmarried men and women whose passage was paid for by\\r\\nLars Johnson Haave and Joe Fölie, who may perhaps be regarded as the\\r\\nleaders of this party. Most of those named were men of means, and some\\r\\nof them were owners of valuable estates which were of course sold and\\r\\nconverted into cash upon emigrating to America. _Albion_ took eight\\r\\nweeks for the voyage. _Kong Sverre_ took twelve. The former arrived in\\r\\nNew York about July 25th.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [280] One of whom married Ole Tenold; they moved to Calmar, Iowa.\\r\\n        The Orvedal family all moved to Winneshiek County in the\\r\\n        fifties.\\r\\nFrom New York they took the usual inland route to Chicago, their\\r\\ndestination being Wiota. But at Belvidere in Boone County, they met\\r\\nThor Olson Kaasa, who advised them strongly against going to Wiota,\\r\\nwhich, he said, was two hundred miles from a market. La Fayette County\\r\\nwas moreover nothing but hills, and he gave such an unfavorable\\r\\ndescription of that locality, that the immigrants decided to accept\\r\\nhis suggestion and go to Long Prairie, where they were told there was\\r\\nplenty of level and fertile land only seventy miles from Chicago. A few\\r\\nwere deputed to wait at Belvidere for those who were coming on _Kong\\r\\nSverre_, and inform them of the change in plans, the rest accompanied\\r\\nKaasa to Boone County,[281] where also soon after the second party\\r\\ncame. Thus by the autumn of 1844 the settlement numbered about one\\r\\nhundred individuals.[282]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [281] Anfin Seim, who had come on _Juno_, was in Chicago when they\\r\\n        came there; he joined them there when they started for Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [282] Some of them moved away a few years later as had already been\\r\\n        indicated in the notes on the preceding pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1845 about fifty persons settled near Capron. It has\\r\\nalready been observed that the Kaasa family moved out there that\\r\\nyear from Chicago.[283] Others came directly from Sogn, Norway, the\\r\\nrecruiting region being Vik Parish exclusively. In that year three\\r\\nships left Bergen again with immigrants principally from Sogn,\\r\\nespecially Aurland and Vik. Those who came from Aurland went to\\r\\nKoshkonong, as also many of those who came from Vik. One of these ships\\r\\nwas _Albion_, Captain Brock, the passengers of which went, most of\\r\\nthem, to Long Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [283] The family numbered ten persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative to the voyage of _Albion_, Elim Ellingson of Capron, who\\r\\nwas on this ship, tells me the following incident which occurred in\\r\\nmid-ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"One day a boat carrying seven or eight men, rather ugly in\\r\\n  appearance, evidently Spanish pirates, approached us from the west,\\r\\n  and their leader demanded to speak with the captain. They said\\r\\n  they came from the New Foundland coast and wanted to send some\\r\\n  letters back. Thereupon they veered about and rowed back to their\\r\\n  ship which lay some distance to the west, put out nine boats with\\r\\n  a large number of men and rowed back toward our ship. The captain,\\r\\n  suspecting their purpose and realizing that we would be helpless\\r\\n  before an attack of pirates, turned the ship around and sailed\\r\\n  back for one whole day and night. In the meantime a considerable\\r\\n  tumult arose on board, axes and guns being gotten in readiness and\\r\\n  many carried up stones from the ballast. We succeeded, however, in\\r\\n  escaping, and, after sailing a day and a night, we turned back and\\r\\n  arrived safely in New York. Here we learned that recently a ship\\r\\n  had arrived at port, the masts of which had been entirely destroyed\\r\\n  by guns from a pirate attack.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ellingson in telling this, added that it is doubtful what fate\\r\\nmight have awaited them, had not the captain promptly turned the ship\\r\\nabout and succeeded in escaping what most certainly would have been a\\r\\nsimilar attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came on that ship at the same time, and who located\\r\\nat Capron, were: Johans Dahle from Voss, his wife, Ingebjör, and son,\\r\\nOle;[284] Lasse Ellingson Aase (b. 1808), wife Gjöri Ravsdal and five\\r\\nchildren, Ragnild,[285] Elling (Elim), (b. 1835), Nils, Endre and\\r\\nBritha; Andres E. Aase, wife and two sons;[286] Anders O. Torvold,\\r\\nJohannes Lie (now living in Goodhue County, Minnesota), and Johanna\\r\\nStadhem. John Benson of Capron tells me that his grandmother, Martha\\r\\nNumedal, a widow, came there in 1845 or 1846, and also the following:\\r\\nJoe Sande, who was married to a Miss Aase, Edlend Myrkeskog, wife Eli\\r\\nand daughter Ingebjör,[287] and Ole Myrkeskog, who is living at Capron\\r\\nyet at the age of eighty.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [284] A son Andres Dahle was not in the ship, says Elim Ellingson,\\r\\n        and probably did not come therefore until the next year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [285] Who married Sjur Ölman, who also came in 1844 and settled in\\r\\n        Cottage Grove Township, Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [286] Andres Aase and family soon after moved to Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, and settled near Cambridge; they finally located\\r\\n        permanently in Winneshiek County, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [287] Edlend Myrkeskog died about 1850, and the widow later moved\\r\\n        to Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Prairie Settlement continued to grow for a decade. Space does\\r\\nnot, however, permit printing here the complete list of later arrivals,\\r\\nkindly supplied me by Elim Ellingson and John Benson.[288] We shall now\\r\\nspeak briefly of the growth of the old settlement of Muskego.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [288] Mr. Benson came there in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Growth of the Racine County (Muskego) Settlement,\\r\\n                      1843-1847. Personal Notes._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XV we discussed briefly immigration to Racine County in\\r\\n1841-1842. The period of largest growth of the settlement was between\\r\\n1842 and 1847; an especially large party came in 1843. After 1847\\r\\nthe arrivals that became permanent residents were few and scattered.\\r\\nIn the early fall of 1842 there arrived at one time a party of forty\\r\\npersons. They had embarked at Langesund about May 30th, were over\\r\\neleven weeks on the ocean, arriving in New York August 16th. Here\\r\\nthey met Elling Eielson, who accompanied them to Albany; three weeks\\r\\nlater they landed in Milwaukee. Among others there were the following\\r\\npersons: Hermo Nilsen Tufte and family from Aal in Hallingdal, Johan\\r\\nLandsverk and family from Tuddal, Telemarken, Sondre N. Maaren and wife\\r\\nand his brothers Östein and Nils from Tin, Östen G. Meland also from\\r\\nTin, Tostein E. Cleven and Aanund Bjaan (Bjoin) and family who were\\r\\nthe first to emigrate from Siljord. Of these several remained only\\r\\ntemporarily; thus Anders Dahlen went to Winnebago County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nabout 1848, in company with Ole Myhre, an immigrant of the year 1843.\\r\\nKjittel Busness, who was a brother to the said Ole Myhre\\'s wife, also\\r\\nremained in Racine County only a few years, then he went to Stoughton,\\r\\nDane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nSondre Maaren settled on section 34, Town of Norway, where he and his\\r\\nwife lived in a dug-out for a time; later, selling out to a Mr. Sawyer,\\r\\nthey moved to Jefferson Prairie and ultimately to Cresco, Iowa. Aanund\\r\\nBjoin died in 1847; the son Halvor, then eighteen years old, walked to\\r\\nKoshkonong with the view of selecting land and settling there, and the\\r\\nrest of the family moved there that same year. Johan Landsverk, who was\\r\\na brother of Ole Landsverk, an immigrant of 1838, settled on Yorkville\\r\\nPrairie and remained there till 1854, when he moved to Sande in\\r\\nChickasaw County, Iowa, where he lived till his death. A son, Peder J.\\r\\nLandsverk, born 1840, occupied the homestead later; he died in January,\\r\\n1908. Hermo Nilson Tufte and family located on section 31 in Raymond\\r\\nTownship; here he lived till his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been said, Tufte came from Aal Parish, Hallingdal, and was\\r\\nnot only the first emigrant to America from Aal, but it seems, also\\r\\nthe first from the Valley of Hallingdal. The Tufte farm lay in the\\r\\nextreme north of the valley close up under the mountains; the region is\\r\\nextremely cold, much of it covered by snow the whole year round. The\\r\\nfamily was extremely poor; of a pious nature and fervid adherents of\\r\\nHans Nilsen Hauge. Besides the father and mother there was a son, Nils,\\r\\nand a daughter, Sigrid. The latter, in whom the piety of the mother\\r\\nhad found strong expression, was attracted to the young lay preacher,\\r\\nEielson, and in July the next year became his wife. The son, Nils,\\r\\nmarried in 1865 a daughter of Ole Sanderson in Perry Township, Dane\\r\\nCounty, and lived on the old homestead until he died about 1901. The\\r\\ndaughter, Julia, married Thomas Adland of North Cape, Racine County,\\r\\nand another daughter, Betsey, married O. B. Dahle of Perry, Dane\\r\\nCounty. Hermo Nilson and his wife both died in the latter part of the\\r\\nsixties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree different parties of immigrants, nearly all from Telemarken, came\\r\\nto Racine County in 1843. One, the so-called Wigeland party, left Skien\\r\\nearly in the spring by ship commanded by Captain Bloom, sailing to\\r\\nHavre, France. The second party, going about the same time, sailed out\\r\\nfrom Skien by the _Olius_, Captain Björnson, also going to Havre. Of\\r\\nthe third party we shall speak below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Havre those in the first party seem to have engaged passage on an\\r\\nAmerican ship _Argo_, a five-masted sailing vessel loaded with Swedish\\r\\niron bound for New York. While _Olius_ was laid up for repairs, the\\r\\nAmerican captain began cutting prices, offering at last to take the\\r\\nnew arrivals to New York for nine five-franc pieces each (or about\\r\\n$8). Many did not dare to take passage on the _Argo_, fearing that\\r\\nsome trick was being played on them, but most of them went. _Argo_\\r\\nproved a good sailer, reaching New York four weeks ahead of _Olius_.\\r\\nThere were, however, long delays in New York and Buffalo, so that the\\r\\nimmigrants did not reach Milwaukee before August 15th. Among those who\\r\\ncame on the _Argo_ were: Arentz Wigeland and wife Gunild, his aged\\r\\nfather Andrew Wigeland, and his brothers George and Andrew, and two\\r\\nsisters; Halvor Pederson Haugholt, with wife Tone and four sons and two\\r\\ndaughters, Gunild and Ingeborg; Ole Overson Haukom and family, eleven\\r\\nin all; Anders Jacobson Rönningen, wife Kjersti and three sons;[289]\\r\\nJens Hundkjilen and Anders Smekaasa; Amund S. Sötholt, his brother,\\r\\nSören S. Sötholt, Sven S. Klomset; Lars Tinderholt; Nils H. Narum,\\r\\nHalvor Nisson, John Maaren, Nils Rue, John Kossin, John Husevold,\\r\\nall with families; Östen Ingusland, John Husevold, Hans Tveito,\\r\\nSvein Nordgaarden, Gjermon T. Nordgaarden, Mathias H. Kroken, wife\\r\\nand children, his wife\\'s sister Anne and their mother Sissel; Ole O.\\r\\nStorlie, with wife,[290] four sons and two daughters; Kjittil Haugan\\r\\nand family; Gunuld K. Maaren, Gro Grave and her mother; Halvor I.\\r\\nDoksrud, wife and two sons, Halvor and Ingebret. All these, about one\\r\\nhundred in all, were from different parts of Telemarken. Besides there\\r\\nwere sixteen persons from Sætersdalen as follows: Tollef Gunnufson\\r\\nHuset, wife Hæge Olson and six children from Bygland, Augun Berge and\\r\\nwife from Vallö, Kjögei Harstad from Vallö, Tollef Knudson and wife\\r\\nand three children from Holestad Parish, and Tolleif Röisland and Ole\\r\\nNummeland from Vallö, the first emigrants from Sætersdalen to America.\\r\\nAll but the last two of these went to Muskego.[291]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [289] One of whom, Jacob, now lives in Racine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [290] It was Mrs. Ole Storlie, who was accidentally shot by Sören\\r\\n        Bakke, which unfortunate event seems to have been the chief\\r\\n        cause why Bakke, almost crazed with grief, gave up pioneer\\r\\n        life and returned to Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [291] Röisland and Vigeland settled at Pine Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nArentz Wigeland, born 1812, who may be regarded as the leader, had\\r\\nsailed for seven years between Boston and the West Indies and along the\\r\\nAmerican Atlantic coast. Passing the winters in Boston he had learned\\r\\nthe English language, and in 1842 returned to his home in Bamle,\\r\\nNorway, to bring his family to America. He became the chief promoter of\\r\\nthe considerable immigration from Lower Telemarken that year. Wigeland\\r\\nsettled in Yorkville Township. In 1844 he married Gunild Pederson; he\\r\\ndied in 1862. The daughter Maren (b. 1845) married John W. Johnson in\\r\\n1865. Mrs. Wigeland died in Racine in 1897. Haugholt (b. 1799) was from\\r\\nSaude Parish in Lower Telemarken. He settled on section 18 in the Town\\r\\nof Raymond; there he died in 1882, his wife[292] died in 1876, aged\\r\\n79 years. Their oldest son Ole, who was drowned in the fifties in the\\r\\nNorway marshes, was the first person buried in the Yorkville Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [292] She was Gunild Wigeland; they were married in 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\nNels Narum was from Stathelle in Bamle Parish; he settled in Norway\\r\\nTownship on section 20. Both he and his wife died in 1887, about\\r\\neighty-seven years old. Hans Tveito (Twito) settled in the part of the\\r\\nsettlement that lay in Waukesha County; he moved to Houston County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1855 and in 1866 to Filmore County; Halvor Nissen who\\r\\nwas from Bamle, also settled in Waukesha County. Ole Overson was from\\r\\nHviteseid Parish; when they came to Norway they lived for some time\\r\\nwith John Dale (who had come from Norway in 1837 with Mons K. Aadland\\r\\nand Ole Rynning). In 1845 he preëmpted land in section 34, where his\\r\\nson Frank Overson lived until quite recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur third party of emigrants were from Upper Telemarken, mostly from\\r\\nSiljord Parish. They came on the ship _Vinterflid_.[293] Among those\\r\\nin the party were: Knud S. Kvistrud and Kari Berge from Tin, Egil O.\\r\\nCleven and family, and a cousin Knut Haugan, wife and two daughters\\r\\nfrom Langelev; Björn Stondal, Ole O. Hedejord[294] and wife Liv, three\\r\\ndaughters, Esther, Ida and Etta, and two sons, Ole and Edward; Torbjörn\\r\\nG. Vik and family, who later moved to Koshkonong; Aanund Drotning\\r\\nwho also went to Koshkonong that same year;[295] Aase and Ingeborg\\r\\nOlson[296] from Mandal, Telemarken. John Homme from Siljord, father\\r\\nof Reverend G. Homme, founder of the Indian School at Wittenberg,\\r\\nWisconsin, also came at the same time, as also Ole Myren and wife\\r\\nBergit, and Torgrim Busness and wife Anne from Tin, who moved to\\r\\nSpringfield Township, Winneshiek County, Iowa, in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [293] Many of the facts relative to this party were gathered on\\r\\n        a visit at the home of Mrs. Ingeborg Roswall, Whitewater,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, August 12, 1908; Mrs. Roswall does not remember\\r\\n        the name of the Captain of the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [294] Ole Hedejord died on Koshkonong; Liv is still living, with\\r\\n        her grandchildren on the old homestead, near Waterford, in\\r\\n        the Town of Yorkville.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [295] Edwin Drotning of Stoughton tells me that his father Anon\\r\\n        remained a while in Milwaukee before going to Koshkonong,\\r\\n        where he located, as we know in 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [296] These two sisters married Tostein and Gulleik Cleven in\\r\\n        1844. Tostein and Aase Cleven lived in Yorkville till 1866,\\r\\n        when they moved to Pleasant Spring, Dane County, Wisconsin.\\r\\n        Tostein died in 1893, Aase in 1905, leaving four daughters\\r\\n        and three sons: Mrs. Astri Drotning, Mrs. Ed. Drotning, both\\r\\n        of Stoughton, Wisconsin, Mrs. Anna Howe, Mrs. Edwin Bjoin,\\r\\n        Rice Lake, Wisconsin, Ed., Thomas, and Henry. Thomas Cleven\\r\\n        occupies the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year also Ole Heg, son of Even Heg and a brother of Colonel Hans\\r\\nC. Heg,[297] came and settled in Racine County, as also Knud Langeland\\r\\nfrom Samnanger, who in 1866 became the first editor of _Skandinaven_\\r\\nfounded that year by John Anderson in Chicago. Knud Langeland lived\\r\\nat first in Muskego, later at North Cape, Racine County. In 1849 he\\r\\nmarried Anna Hatlestad (born in Skjold Parish, Ryfylke, in 1830), whose\\r\\nparents Jens O. Hatlestad and wife Anne had immigrated in 1846, and\\r\\nsettled in the Town of Norway. Knud Langeland was also the first editor\\r\\nof _Amerika_, which began publication in Chicago in 1884. During the\\r\\nlast years of his life Langeland lived in North Cape and in Milwaukee,\\r\\nwhere he died in 1888; his wife died in 1908, at the home of her\\r\\nson, Dr. Peter Langeland with whom she had lived since her husband\\'s\\r\\ndeath.[298]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [297] Ole Heg is still living in Burlington, Racine County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [298] The other children are James, Charles, and Frank Langeland,\\r\\n        and Mrs. Harry Brimble of Chicago, and Leroy Langeland, who\\r\\n        is news editor of the _Evening Wisconsin_, Milwaukee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came three persons from Voss to Racine County in 1843, namely,\\r\\nKnut S. Skjerve (b. 1808), and wife Kari, and his unmarried sister,\\r\\nBrita Selheim. Skjerve located in Norway, Racine County, in the\\r\\nneighborhood of Nils Johnson. In 1847 Skjerve sold his land to Knut\\r\\nK. Aaretuen from Sogn and went to Jefferson Prairie, Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, where he bought a farm and lived till his death in 1892; his\\r\\nwife died there in 1873.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1844-1846 the increase in immigration was constant, though not\\r\\nlarge. In 1847 there arrived a considerable number. The scattered\\r\\naccessions of these years represent as widely removed parishes as\\r\\nSkien, Lærdal in Sogn, and Namsos in Trondhjem. The following is a\\r\\npartial list: 1844, John Larson and Peter Jacobson and family from\\r\\nStathelle, Bamle, Johannes J. Quala from near Stavanger; Thormod S.\\r\\nFlattre with wife Ingeborg (Lydahl)[299] and children from Voss, who\\r\\nsettled in Norway Township, Halvor O. Skare and wife Margrete and two\\r\\nchildren from Lower Telemarken, who located in Norway Township in\\r\\n1845;[300] John I. Berge and wife Julia, and Hans H. Bakke and wife\\r\\nIngeborg, who moved to Spring Grove in 1854, and Peder Torgerson\\r\\nand wife Anne and five children from Kragerö.[301] In 1846: Jens\\r\\nO. Hatlestad and wife (see above page 284) parents of Rev. O. J.\\r\\nHatlestad, pioneer publisher, minister, and author of _Historiske\\r\\nMiddelelser om den norske Augustana-Synode_, Decorah, Iowa, 1877;\\r\\nElling Spillom, wife Maren and three sons, Ole, Hendrik, and Mikkel and\\r\\none daughter; Ole Homstad and Mathias Homstad, both with families, from\\r\\nNamsos in Trondhjem Diocese;[302] they settled in Raymond Township;\\r\\nHalvor and Ingebret Roswald[303] from Gjerpen. Knudt K. Hedle, wife\\r\\nand sons Mathias, Peter, and daughter Betsy from Lærdal, Sogn; Tyke\\r\\nHendrikson Lökken and wife Anne from Gjerpen, who bought the Aslak Aas\\r\\nfarm in Norway Township; they had four children, Hans, Ole, Peter and\\r\\nMaria.[304] In 1847: Peter M. Andsion from Namsos, with wife and four\\r\\nchildren (three daughters and a son); they settled in Norway Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [299] Thomas F. Thompson, who died in Leland, Illinois, in 1908,\\r\\n        was their son.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [300] He moved to Winchester, Wisconsin, in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [301] Torgerson removed to Wheeler Prairie, Dane County, in 1846.\\r\\n        One of the children Anne Tomine, married Ole C. Erikson in\\r\\n        1854 and they moved to Lake Mills, Jefferson County. In the\\r\\n        spring of 1867 they moved to Stoughton, Wisconsin, where\\r\\n        Erikson was one of the first promoters of the Stoughton Wagon\\r\\n        Company. Mrs. Erikson is still living in Stoughton.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [302] They were the first families to emigrate from Trondhjem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [303] Ingebret Roswald married Ingeborg Cleven in 1854, and they\\r\\n        then settled in Dodge County. The widow is now living in\\r\\n        Whitewater, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [304] Hans died in 1856, Ole died in Milwaukee in 1901. Peter\\r\\n        Hendrikson graduated from Beloit College, held a chair in\\r\\n        Modern Languages there for about ten years, was later editor\\r\\n        of _Skandinaven_ and Principal of Albion Academy, Albion,\\r\\n        Wisconsin. Is now engaged in farming in the State of Maine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this year Captain Hans Friis from Farsund, Agder, Norway, settled in\\r\\nMuskego. Friis was a sailor with _Enigheden_ in 1837 (see above page\\r\\n96), and between 1837 and 1847 had made nine journeys to America. After\\r\\nsettling in Muskego he continued for many years sailing on the Great\\r\\nLakes. In 1848 the following came to Muskego: George J. Björgaas from\\r\\nHoug, Voss,[305] Tollef O. Öien from Tönset, Österdalen (removed to\\r\\nKewanee County in 1855), and J. H. Skarie, from Hadeland, who located\\r\\nin Town of Norway. This year also brought to Muskego the pioneer\\r\\nminister Hans Andreas Stub (b. 1822), who had that spring received and\\r\\naccepted the call to the Muskego church. Knut and Anna Aaretuen from\\r\\nAurland, Sogn, also appear among the number; they bought the farm of\\r\\nKnut S. Skjerve in Norway Township. In 1854 they moved to Winneshiek\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, and about 1860 to Gilmore County, Minnesota. John T. and\\r\\nChristoffer Olson from Romskogen in Rödenæs, Halvor \"Modum\" from Modum,\\r\\nNorway, and Guro Wait and son Reuben from Österdalen, Norway, all came\\r\\nin 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [305] His parents with family of ten came in 1849. George Björgaas\\r\\n        moved to Adams County, in 1849, where he has lived since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brief outline of the growth of the settlement represents fairly\\r\\ncompletely the increase by immigration from Norway between 1842 and\\r\\n1850. The wave of migration had long ago moved westward; it had\\r\\nalready gone beyond Koshkonong also. It was northern and western\\r\\nDane County and southern Columbia County that were now the Mecca of\\r\\nimmigrants. In the meantime some small settlements in Walworth and\\r\\nJefferson Counties had already been founded. We shall, therefore,\\r\\nbriefly discuss these now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Heart Prairie Settlement in Walworth County,\\r\\n                   Wisconsin. Skoponong. Pine Lake._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWalworth County forms one of the southern tier of counties in\\r\\nWisconsin, being situated between Rock on the west and Kenosha and\\r\\nRacine on the east; to the north lies Jefferson County. There are four\\r\\nNorwegian settlements in the county, as follows: (1) in the southern\\r\\npart of the Town of Whitewater and the northern part of the Town of\\r\\nRichmond lies the Heart Prairie Settlement, taking its name from the\\r\\nbeautiful little prairie directly east of it; (2) about four miles east\\r\\nof the city of Whitewater lies Skoponong, partly in Whitewater Township\\r\\nand extending north into Jefferson County as far as Palmyra; (3) in\\r\\nthe city of Whitewater there is a considerable Norwegian colony, and\\r\\n(4) about six miles southeast of Heart Prairie lies the Sugar Creek\\r\\nSettlement, extending from about five miles north of Delavan to about\\r\\nthree miles northeast of Elk Horn, the county seat of Walworth County.\\r\\nIt is the first of these settlements that we shall discuss in this\\r\\nchapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settlers at Heart Prairie were Ole A. Sögal and\\r\\nwife Kari, who, with their four children Anne, Andrea, Karen, and\\r\\nJohanne, came in 1842 and located four miles and a half southeast of\\r\\nthe city of Whitewater. They lived there only a few years, however,\\r\\nthen moved to Wautoma, Waushara County, in Central Wisconsin. The next\\r\\nsettler was Ole\\'s brother, Hans A. Milebon, who with his wife Kari came\\r\\nin 1843, and settled about a mile north of his brother\\'s place; they\\r\\nhad one daughter, Mary Ann, who was about three years old when they\\r\\ncame, and who is still living near Whitewater.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1844 a number of families arrived from Norway and\\r\\nsettled at Heart Prairie. They were as follows: Hans Arveson Vale and\\r\\nwife Aaste (Esther), with children Arve (or Harvey) and Isak. Mr.\\r\\nArveson bought his first eighty acres at government price of $1.25\\r\\nper acre, and built his log house in the fall of 1844. In this log\\r\\ncabin many a Norwegian immigrant found a temporary home upon his\\r\\nfirst arrival in Wisconsin in the early days of the settlement. Here\\r\\nMr. Arveson lived, cultivating his own farm, until his death in 1873\\r\\nat the age of sixty-one; the widow died in June, 1900, at the age\\r\\nof eighty-six. Hans Thompson and wife Marie also came in 1844; they\\r\\nhad three children, Thomas, Karen and Ann. He bought land adjoining\\r\\nArveson\\'s farm, lived the first winter in a dug-out. But the next\\r\\nspring \"when the snakes began to come in,\" writes my informant, they\\r\\nmoved to the Arveson\\'s where they lived till they got their log-house\\r\\nbuilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndres J. Skipnes and his wife Aaste also came at the time; they\\r\\nsettled near Ole Arveson, but lived there only a short time, then\\r\\nmoved to a farm near Stoughton, Wisconsin. Ole J. Vale and wife Anne\\r\\nlikewise came in the same party, but they went to Sugar Creek, where\\r\\na son, John, and a daughter, Annie Torine, had located the year\\r\\nbefore.[306] Another arrival at this time was Peder H. Swerge, and Ole\\r\\nTölvson Grönsteen and wife Kari and three children, Tosten Olson, a\\r\\ncarpenter, and wife Aaste, Karine, a daughter of Halvor Anderson, came\\r\\nin 1844. Tosten built most of the log-cabins that were erected in the\\r\\nsettlement for a number of years. His wife died soon after coming to\\r\\nAmerica, and Tosten died in the Civil War. Finally the accessions of\\r\\n1844 included also the following persons: Gunder H. Lunde, Anne Kosa,\\r\\nOle O. Huset and family, John C. Opsal, and Halvor Huset. The latter\\r\\ntwo remained only a short time, then went west; Ole O. Huset located on\\r\\nKoshkonong.[307]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [306] The rest of their children who came with them were Aaste, a\\r\\n        widow, Andrea, Anders, and Anne Christine.\\r\\nThomas Thompson married Mary Ann, daughter of Christen Mason. They\\r\\nlived on the Thompson homestead till their death; Thomas died in 1869,\\r\\nhis wife in 1871. They had six children, of whom Hans, the oldest,\\r\\nlives at Forest City, Iowa. Karen Thompson, oldest daughter of Hans\\r\\nThompson, married Jens Skipnes (better known as John A. Johnson of\\r\\nthe firm, Fuller and Johnson, Madison, Wisconsin), and with him lived\\r\\nnear Stoughton, Wisconsin, where she died about four years after their\\r\\nmarriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [307] See Koshkonong Church Register, page 324 below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the above thirty-one persons who emigrated in 1844 were from the\\r\\nvicinity of Skien in Holden, and all came on the same ship, namely,\\r\\n_Salvator_, Captain Johan Gasman. They were nine weeks on the ocean,\\r\\nlanding in New York July 4th; they came by the regular route to\\r\\nMilwaukee, thence they drove in lumber wagons to Heart Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the year 1845 the following accessions are to be noted: The\\r\\nbrothers Nils and Gunder C. Opsal; Halvor A. Lunde and wife Ann and\\r\\nsix children, most of them grown up, and another son Gulleik and wife\\r\\nDorothea; Anders J. Björndokken; Johans Grönsteen with wife Maria and\\r\\nthree children. For 1846 we note the following: Anders Gunderson, John\\r\\nArveson and wife Kjersti and four children;[308] Lukas Ingebretson;\\r\\nAnders G. Bjerva, wife Anne and four children:[309] Anne, Börte Maria,\\r\\nKaren, and Jens, who many years ago moved to Crookston, Minnesota; and\\r\\nJohn Grönsteen and wife Asberg. All those who came during the years\\r\\n1845-46 were from near Skien.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [308] The mother and one child died that same fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [309] She was a widow when he married her. The children of the\\r\\n        second marriage were: Gunder, Christen (Whitewater), Esther\\r\\n        (who was Mrs. Chas. Sobye, Stoughton, Wisconsin, but now\\r\\n        dead). Anders Bjerva and wife died many years ago.\\r\\nIn 1847 Christen M. Bö, wife Inger and four children from Gjerpen came\\r\\nto Heart Prairie; and in 1848 came Ole Nilsen from Christiansand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn either 1848 or 1849 came Nils, Steen and Ole Haatvedt; Nils moved\\r\\nto Wautoma, and Ole settled in Waupaca after living a few years at\\r\\nHeart Prairie. In 1850 Hans Hanson, a blacksmith, came from Holdon and\\r\\nlocated there; he worked for a time with the George Esterly Harvesting\\r\\nMachine Co., then bought a farm, which he occupied till his death\\r\\nin 1893. Another blacksmith by the name of Claus Hanson came at the\\r\\nsame time; worked at his trade for a while in Whitewater then went to\\r\\nMichigan, married and came back and settled in Milwaukee, where he is\\r\\nstill living. In 1851 Arve Gunderson Vale emigrated; his son Hans Vale\\r\\nhad come in 1844; Arve Vale lived only a week after arriving. With him\\r\\ncame Gunder H. Vala and wife Kersti and seven children; they moved to\\r\\nVermillion, South Dakota, a few years later, all except the oldest\\r\\nson Halvor, who is living at Rio, Wisconsin. In that year (1851) came\\r\\nalso Christopher Steenson Haatvedt and his two brothers-in-law, Peter\\r\\nKystelson Haatvedt and Christen J. Tveit, while in 1852 came Jörgen A.\\r\\nNilson Vibito and wife Karen Kristine, née Hanson, and six children.\\r\\nJörgen Nilson had taught parochial school in Norway for twenty-nine\\r\\nyears and continued to do so here for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is a complete account of all arrivals to the settlement from\\r\\nNorway down to the year 1852; the roster of settlers here given has\\r\\nbeen patiently gathered during several months of research by Mr. Harvey\\r\\nArveson[310] of Whitewater, himself the oldest son of the third settler\\r\\nin the community, namely Hans Arveson Vale, of whom we have spoken\\r\\nabove. I have followed his manuscript closely, omitting only certain\\r\\nfacts of family and personal history. Mr. Arveson speaks briefly of\\r\\nthe trying summer and fall of 1846 when for a time sickness and death\\r\\nseemed to threaten to exterminate the settlers of Heart Prairie. I\\r\\nwill quote from his own account of the condition; speaking of John\\r\\nGrönsteen, who came in 1846 and died that same fall, he continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n  There was so much sickness here at that time that there was hardly\\r\\n  any one well enough to bury those that died; and well can I\\r\\n  remember that the men had to come down to our house and rest before\\r\\n  they could finish the grave, and well can I remember that the cow\\r\\n  stood outside bellowing to be milked and no one able to milk her;\\r\\n  everybody was thirsty as all had fever and ague and had to go a\\r\\n  mile for water before we got to the well, and sometimes no one able\\r\\n  to go after it. I am sure a great many died for want of care, as\\r\\n  there was none that understood the English language and did not\\r\\n  understand how to take their medicine. Those were hard times, and\\r\\n  to many this account may sound incredible; nevertheless, it is true\\r\\n  and I could write volumes and tell true incidents of the trials and\\r\\n  hardships that the old pioneers had to endure.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [310] I acknowledge here with gratitude Mr. Arveson\\'s valuable aid.\\r\\n        It is only through such intelligent interest and patient effort\\r\\n        on the part of the sons of the pioneers themselves, who have\\r\\n        continued to live in the community, that such reliable facts\\r\\n        can be secured.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitewater city received no Norwegian settlers until in the fifties,\\r\\ntherefore an account of their coming falls outside the scope of our\\r\\ndiscussion. Of the old Skoponong Settlement I am able to give only\\r\\na few general facts. The first settlers came in 1843-44; they were:\\r\\nKittil Jordgrev, Hans Bukaasa, and Björn Lien from Upper Telemarken,\\r\\nHans and Harald Nordbö from Flaa, Hallingdal, Ole Lia from Hiterdal,\\r\\nHalvor Valkaasa from Sauland, Lars Johnson Lee, Sjur Hydle, Knut T.\\r\\nRio, and Tollef Grane from Voss, and Anon Dalos; several of these\\r\\nhad families. Lars Lee and wife Britha came to Muskego in the summer\\r\\nof 1843 and to Skoponong early in the fall, and were therefore among\\r\\nthe very earliest in that locality. They lived there until 1861, when\\r\\nthey located at Spring Prairie, Town of Leeds, Columbia County.[311]\\r\\nIn his history of the Skoponong Congregation (founded in 1844), C. M.\\r\\nMason, Secretary of the congregation, names also the following among\\r\\nthe earliest members of the church: Halvor Mathison (in whose house the\\r\\nchurch was organized in 1844), Styrk Erikson, Knud Dokstad, Nils Herre,\\r\\nOle Sjurson, Simon Sakrison, Jacob Kaasne, Halvor Glenna, Mathias\\r\\nBaura, Björn Hefte, Sjur Flittre, Lars Klove, Mathias Lia and Even\\r\\nGulseth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [311] Lars Lee died in 1883, his wife in 1905. Dr. Lewis Johnson Lee\\r\\n        of De Forest, Wisconsin, is their son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 Syver O. Haaland, wife and nine children, Hadle Evenson\\r\\nand wife Anne J. Fjösne, and Tostein H. and Osmond O. Högstul came\\r\\nto Skoponong, the latter two from Tuddal in Telemarken; the former\\r\\nwere from Etne Parish in Söndhordland. Björn Holland of Hollandale,\\r\\nWisconsin, who is a son of Syver Haaland,[312] writes me that they came\\r\\non the ship _Kong Sverre_ from Bergen.[313] In Ulvestad\\'s _Nordmaendene\\r\\ni Amerika_, page 56, appears an account of their first few weeks in\\r\\nthe settlement and of S. Haaland\\'s sickness and death. The Högstul\\r\\nparty came in a brig by the name of _Washington_, which carried iron\\r\\nfrom Tvedestrand, commanded by a Norwegian captain by the name of Simon\\r\\nCook. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"In Milwaukee, there were only a few stores at the time. We drove\\r\\n  with oxen and a wagon to the so-called Skoponong Settlement near\\r\\n  Whitewater. When we came there nearly all the settlers lay ill with\\r\\n  ague, the condition was wretched. We immediately began to rid and\\r\\n  break some land and after a while we got so far that we could raise\\r\\n  some wheat. But we had to haul it fifty miles to Milwaukee with\\r\\n  oxen; there we got 25 cents per bushel.... wages was usually 25\\r\\n  cents a day in the spring and fall; in the haying it was 50 cents.\\r\\n  But there was little work to get. Like other settlers my parents\\r\\n  were poor. My mother made baskets from withes; these she then\\r\\n  carried on her back about the prairie and sold them to Americans,\\r\\n  getting in return for them flour, pork and garments, in order that\\r\\n  we should not suffer distress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [312] The family changed the name to Holland in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [313] Letter of May 5, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nHadle Evenson moved to Perry, Wisconsin, in 1854, where Mrs. Evenson\\r\\ndied in 1861. The oldest son Edwin Hadley, enlisting in Co. E, 15th\\r\\nWisconsin, was killed at the Battle of New Hope Church, Georgia, in\\r\\nMay, 1864. In 1875 Mr. Evenson settled at Slater, Story County, Iowa.\\r\\nPeter Hadley, Treasurer of Webster County, is the only surviving son.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the early settlers at Skoponong was Mrs. Ingeborg Nelson who came\\r\\nfrom Evanger, Voss, in 1849. She left Skoponong a few years later,\\r\\nsettling permanently at Deerfield, Dane County, in 1853, where she\\r\\nis still living at the age of ninety-five. Mrs. Nelson is the mother\\r\\nof Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota, who was born in Norway in 1843.\\r\\nKnute Nelson was educated at Albion Academy, Albion, Wisconsin, and\\r\\nremoved to Alexandria, Minnesota in 1871. He was Governor of Minnesota\\r\\nduring 1892-1895. In the latter year he was elected U. S. Senator and\\r\\nhas been reëlected twice since, serving now his third term.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall mention one more settler, namely Torstein Rio,[314] born at\\r\\nVossevangen in 1835, who, with his wife Ingeborg (Bershaugen) and\\r\\nfamily came to America in 1849 on the ship _Henrik Wergeland_ and\\r\\nlocated at Skoponong. A brother whose name also was Torstein came at\\r\\nthe same time, and the family included a son Nels (Thompson), who is\\r\\nliving at Madison, Wisconsin, having moved there in 1860.[315] Torstein\\r\\nRio died at Skoponong in 1869, his wife died in Madison in 1876.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [314] Father of Knut Rio.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [315] In 1880 Nels Thompson became a member of the well known firm of\\r\\n        clothiers, Boley, Hinrichs and Thompson, later Hinrichs and\\r\\n        Thompson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Pine Lake and Nashota in northwestern Waukesha County a considerable\\r\\nnumber of Norwegians lived among the forties and fifties, since which\\r\\nthe settlement has dwindled very much.[316] At Pine Lake the first\\r\\nSwedish settlement founded in America in the last century had been\\r\\nestablished in 1841 by Gustav Unonius.[317] In 1843 about fifty\\r\\nNorwegian families located at Pine Lake, according to Unonius _Minnen_,\\r\\n1862, page 3. Unonius mentions especially a Captain Hans Gasman as\\r\\nthe principal figure there. Gasman had a large family of sons and\\r\\ndaughters, and the name is a well known one among the early pioneers\\r\\nof Racine, Waukesha, and Dodge Counties.[318] Other members of the\\r\\nfamily were Charles, Peter and Captain Johan Gasman, who commanded the\\r\\n_Salvator_, plying between Skien and New York. This very ship brought\\r\\na number who located at Pine Lake, among them Halvor Salveson from\\r\\nGjerpen.[319]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [316] Or rather also in part Americanized.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [317] I have discussed this in my _Chapters on Scandinavian\\r\\n        Immigration_ (1906), pages 83-85.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [318] Into this county the settlement extended to and about Ashippun\\r\\n        and Toland.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [319] Many of those who came with Capt. Gasman this time went to\\r\\n        Heart Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the fifty families who came to Pine Lake in 1843 I may name\\r\\nEngelbret Salveson from Gjerpen, Erik Helgeson, Hans Roe, Christen\\r\\nPuttekaasa, Halvor Rosholt, Jacob Rosholt, Peter Næs from near\\r\\nSkien and Gjerpen, Ellef Björnson and Halvor Halvorson from Saude,\\r\\nTelemarken, and Tollef Waller from Eidanger in Lower Telemarken,\\r\\nChristopher Aamodt and Hans Uhlen from Modum, Tolleiv Röisland and Ole\\r\\nNummeland from Vallö in Sætersdalen and Ole Lia from Gausdal.[320]\\r\\nSome of these, as e. g. Halvor Halvorson[321] located in the extreme\\r\\nnorthern part of the settlement at Toland, and John Lia settled across\\r\\nthe Jefferson County line,[322] but most located in Waukesha County at\\r\\nHartland or Nashota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [320] Holand _De norske Settlementers Historie_, page 170, to which\\r\\n        I am indebted chiefly for this roll of immigrants to Nashota,\\r\\n        etc., in 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [321] Halvorson died in the spring of 1908 as the last of the\\r\\n        original Norwegian settlers at Toland; he was born in 1818,\\r\\n        married in 1848 Kirsten Aandrud, who survives him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent years there arrived constantly new settlers from Skien,\\r\\nSætersdal and Gudbrandsdalen, but even in the later forties many began\\r\\nto go to the counties immediately northwest to Waupaca and Portage\\r\\ncounties and elsewhere. In 1850-54 these counties, as also Waushara and\\r\\nWinnebago counties on the south, received hosts of Norwegian settlers,\\r\\nsome coming direct from Norway, a large number however from Racine and\\r\\nDane Counties, and the Pine Lake region.[323] The period of growth\\r\\nin this settlement was therefore relatively short, and the removals\\r\\nrelatively large. The result was that the Norwegians came to live more\\r\\nscattered and the community soon began to lose its distinctive national\\r\\ncharacter. Thus it is significant, that of the ninety services held\\r\\nduring 1907 in _Vor Frelsers Kirke_ at Oconomowoc sixty-three were in\\r\\nthe English language.[324] But we are here touching upon questions\\r\\nwhich it is not our purpose to discuss in connection with the survey of\\r\\nsettlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [322] Through John Lia\\'s influence this then came to be the\\r\\n        destination of the earliest emigrants from Gudbrandsdalen\\r\\n        between 1846-49.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [323] Walworth County contributed some of the number; thus Ole\\r\\n        Sögal, the first Norwegian settler at Heart Prairie, was one\\r\\n        of those who went to Waushara County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [324] By way of comparison the number of English services to\\r\\n        Norwegian as far as statistics are available were in the\\r\\n        following localities: Morris, Ill., 13 of 67, Blue Mounds,\\r\\n        Dane Co., Wis., 0 of 22; Leland, Ill., 14 of 28; Stoughton,\\r\\n        Wis., 35 of 80; Long Prairie, 7 of 25; Koshkonong, 0 of 75;\\r\\n        \"Muskego,\" 41 of 112.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n   _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers at Sugar Creek, Walworth County,\\r\\n    Wisconsin. The influx from Land, Norway, to Wiota and Vicinity,\\r\\n                               1844-1852_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have briefly referred to Sugar Creek, Walworth County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin chapter XXXIII above. This little settlement received its first\\r\\nNorwegian settlers in 1844 when Ole Vale and wife Anne from Holden\\r\\nParish, Skien, located there; with them came the sons John and Anders\\r\\nand the daughters Aasta, Anne, Turine, Andrea and Maria. Vale and his\\r\\nwife lived in Sugar Creek till their death, and the daughters all\\r\\nmarried and settled there. In the same year Ole Kittelson and Nils\\r\\nT. Kvamodden, both unmarried and both also from Holden, came to the\\r\\nsettlement. Ole Kittelson located permanently in Sugar Creek, but Nils\\r\\nKvamodden and wife moved to Norway Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota,\\r\\nin 1857. There they died years ago, the homestead being now occupied by\\r\\nthe son Ole.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian L. Vestremo and wife Ingeborg and three children, and Gunder\\r\\nK. Næseth emigrated from Gjerpen near Skien, in 1844. Næseth moved\\r\\nto Norway, Minnesota, in 1856 and Vestremo in 1857. According to Ole\\r\\nJacobson of Elk Horn, to whom I am indebted for these facts, there\\r\\nwere no further accessions to the colony before 1847. In that year\\r\\nhis parents came from Gjerpen, as also Jacob Torstenson and wife Maren\\r\\nMargrete and three sons Ole, Torsten and Jacob, and a daughter, Maria\\r\\nwith her husband Lars Jensen Teigen and family. With them came also\\r\\nTeigen\\'s mother. Jacob Torstenson died in 1861; the widow is still\\r\\nliving at the old home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Jacobson writes me that his father and family left Skien in April\\r\\nby the ship _Axel (og) Valborg_, Captain Bloom, going first as far as\\r\\nHavre, France. There they waited three weeks, then secured passage\\r\\nwith an American ship, the journey being very slow. Landing in Boston,\\r\\nthey went by train to Albany, thence by canal boat to Buffalo, and by\\r\\nsteamboat via the lakes to Milwaukee, where they arrived sometime in\\r\\nAugust. From Milwaukee they thereupon proceeded to Sugar Creek, where\\r\\nthey located permanently. Ole Jacobson is at present living on the farm\\r\\npurchased in 1847. In 1849 Aslak Rasmusson Slettene with wife Gunild\\r\\nand eight children came from Gjerpen, Norway.[325] Grindemelum, with\\r\\nwife, son, and daughter, also came in 1849, as did Peter J. Gromstulen,\\r\\nwife Svanang and five children, and Nils J. Overholt, wife and two\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [325] Some of the children have moved away, to Minnesota and\\r\\n        Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere do not seem to have been any further accessions of Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants during the pioneer days of the Sugar Creek settlement. In\\r\\nthe sixties quite a number came and located at and about Elk Horn but\\r\\nthese do not fall within the scope of our survey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original home of immigrants from Land, Norway, was Rock Prairie, as\\r\\nwe saw above, chapter XXIV. From this as their distribution point they\\r\\nmigrated west and north, aiding in the founding of other settlements.\\r\\nAs early as 1844 we find one pioneer at Wiota from Land, Norway, namely\\r\\nSyver Johnson Smed (see above page 213). But the influx from Land did\\r\\nnot begin until 1847.[326] In that year two families, numbering in\\r\\nall fourteen persons, arrived via Rock Prairie; they were those of\\r\\nSvend Nörstelien (wife Karen, and five children) and of the widow Kari\\r\\nLillebæk, who had six children.[327] In 1848 Hovel Tollefsrude, wife\\r\\nBertha and children: Christopher, Hans, Jahannes, Siri, and Lovise\\r\\narrived. Further immigrants of that year were: Johannes Brenom, wife\\r\\nIngeborg and three children; Hans Halvorson (Brenna), wife Eli, and\\r\\nchildren, Berte, Halvor and Johannes; Johannes E. Smedsrud, with wife\\r\\nAnne and two sons Engebret and Mathias; and Johannes Smehögen (or Smed)\\r\\nwith wife Engeborg, and two children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [326] Matthew J. Ingebretson of Gratiot, Wis., who came to Wiota\\r\\n        with his parents in 1848, has kindly aided me with many of\\r\\n        the facts on immigration to Wiota in 1847-50.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [327] John Larsen Lillebæk was one of her sons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849 came Torkild Husværet, with wife and three sons, Gulbrand, Lars\\r\\nand Frederik; Ole Monson Tollefsrude, wife Karen and three children,\\r\\nand Nils Aason, Ovre Hasle and wife Ingeborg, who had come to Rock\\r\\nPrairie in 1848 (removed to Wiota in 1848). Hans Lillebæk came in 1850\\r\\nand about twenty in all in 1851-52.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Monson, whom we have mentioned as coming in 1849, was the builder\\r\\nof the old Norwegian church at Wiota, which is still standing; the\\r\\npresent larger and more commodious structure stands on the wall built\\r\\nby Ole Monson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were not very many from other provinces in Norway among those who\\r\\nemigrated to Wiota in the late forties. We have spoken of Ingebrigt\\r\\nFuglegjærdet\\'s coming in 1846 from Long Prairie, where he had lived two\\r\\nyears; he was from Vik, Sogn.[328]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [328] Ingebrigt Johnson removed to Town of Dane, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, in 1851; there he lived till his death in 1893,\\r\\n        his wife having died in 1890. John J. Johnson, retired\\r\\n        farmer, of Lodi, Columbia County, Wisconsin, is their son, as\\r\\n        is also Joseph Johnson of Dane Township in Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Vik came Erik I. Haave and wife in 1847, while Harald Melland\\r\\nand wife Anne came from Telemarken. From Sigdal there came one family\\r\\nin 1848; Ellef (Alef) Johnson and wife Anne. The latter served in the\\r\\nCivil War, in Company G of the Twenty-Second Wisconsin Regiment.[329]\\r\\nIn 1872 he married Mary Larson,[330] of Blanchardville, La Fayette\\r\\nCounty, where they are now living.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [329] He was only sixteen when he enlisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [330] She was a daughter of Ole Larson, who served in the Third\\r\\n        Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, in the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may conclude this chapter by saying that Arne Vinje, whose name is\\r\\nso intimately interlinked with the history of the community, died in\\r\\n1903, having lived on the old homestead for sixty-two years. Of his\\r\\neight children, three are living: Peter S. Anderson, Newell, Iowa,\\r\\nDaniel K. Anderson and Mrs. Martha Brunkow of Woodford, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Continued Immigration from Aurland, Sogn, to\\r\\n                Koshkonong. The Arrival of Settlers from\\r\\n                      Vik Parish, Sogn, in 1845._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1845-1846 immigration to Koshkonong from Laurdal, Vinje and\\r\\nMoe Parishes continued and a considerable number came from Flesberg.\\r\\nThe accessions from Laurdal, Moe, and Hvideseid for these years record\\r\\nthe end of a movement that began in 1843. But that which especially\\r\\ncharacterized the growth of the Koshkonong Settlement in 1845-1846 was\\r\\nthe extensive additions through immigrants from Sogn. So extensive,\\r\\nin fact, was the influx from Sogn these years as to make their total\\r\\nrepresentation on Koshkonong at once exceed that from either Voss or\\r\\nNumedal, and equal to about half that from Telemarken. These four have\\r\\never since been the dominant elements in Koshkonong\\'s population. A\\r\\npart of this immigration from Sogn was from parishes represented among\\r\\nthe arrivals of the year before. Such were Botolf J. Grinde, Ole N.\\r\\nSteenhjerde and Sjur I. Romören from Leikanger, Herman T. Vee, Joseph\\r\\nJ. Gjellum and Hermund O. Offerdal from Lærdal, Anders S. Övrebö,\\r\\nwife Anne and three children from Lyster, Erik L. Grov and Anders H.\\r\\nÖdegaard and wife Martha from Hafslo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut much more significant was the immigration from Aurland Parish in\\r\\n1845-1846, from Sogndal in 1846, and the new immigration from Vik\\r\\nParish in 1845. We shall discuss these three groups in order briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have noted above, Chapter XXXI, that there were several persons from\\r\\nAurland Parish, Sogn, among the immigrants who settled on Koshkonong in\\r\\n1844. I am now in receipt of a letter from Anders J. Flaam of Flaam in\\r\\nAurland, Norway, relative to the earliest emigration from Aurland to\\r\\nAmerica. His letter, as also that of Reverend E. P. Juul, the present\\r\\nMinister of the Parish, shows that the earliest emigrants left there in\\r\\n1844. I quote in translation from Reverend Juul\\'s letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Those who, according to parochial records here, were the first\\r\\n  to emigrate to America are the following: Iver Hansen Vingum, age\\r\\n  twenty-five, unmarried,[331] Ole Torjussen Flaam, age fifty, wife\\r\\n  Anna Botolfsdatter, age forty, and children, Ole, thirteen and a\\r\\n  half years old, and Anders, ten years. Of these, Iver Hansen\\'s\\r\\n  certificate of emigration is shown to have been issued March 20,\\r\\n  1844, and he to have left the district on April 13th the same year.\\r\\n  Ole Torjussen\\'s certificate of emigration was issued on the 13th of\\r\\n  April, 1844, and his departure took place the following day. All\\r\\n  therefore emigrated together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [331] The writer\\'s father has always pronounced the name Vangen, which\\r\\n        also according to Haakon Lie, is the correct form. Iver Vangen\\r\\n        settled on Bonnet Prairie, where his son Hans Vangen is still\\r\\n        living.\\r\\n\\r\\nReverend Juul thereupon gives a list of those who emigrated from\\r\\nAurland in 1845, and while several of these did not settle on\\r\\nKoshkonong it will be of interest to the reader to see this list. I\\r\\ntherefore give it complete here:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"In 1845, on the 19th of April the natives of Aurland\\r\\n  (Aurlændinger) left their native village: Torsten Olsen Bjelde,\\r\\n  (45 years of age) wife, Anna (29), and son, Ole (3½ years);\\r\\n  Iver Ingebrigtsen Ytreli (32 years); Jens Botolfsen Bergkvam\\r\\n  (23½ years); Jens Torgersen Tærum (44½ years), wife Ragnhilde\\r\\n  Monsdatter (27) and son Torger (one year); Sjur Olsen Stundal (19)\\r\\n  and sister Katrine (30); Anna Marie Hansdatter Vangen (28½);\\r\\n  Erik Johannesen Ytreli (43) and wife Marthe Larsdatter (48) and\\r\\n  children; Brita (21 years), Magnilde (18 years), Johannes (16\\r\\n  years), Ingeborg (14 years), Lars (10½ years), Haakon (9 years),\\r\\n  Anna (7 years), Tomas (5 years); Johanne Botolsdatter Ytreli (16\\r\\n  years); Eilef Olson Loven (24 years); Mikkel Knutsen Österbro\\r\\n  (22½ years), and wife Martha Gulvsdatter (27½ years), and son\\r\\n  Knut (two months); Lars Gundersen Gjellum (33½ years) and wife\\r\\n  Gjertrud, and son Knut (4 years); Martha Gundersdatter (17 years);\\r\\n  Josef Johannesen Vindedal (73 years), and wife Anna Jensdatter;\\r\\n  John Johnsen Frondal (28 years) and wife Magnhilde; Rognald\\r\\n  Johannesen Knit (19½ years); Simon A. Gjellum (20 years); Peder\\r\\n  Monsen Loven (34 years); Johanne M. Loven (20 years); Iver J. Stene\\r\\n  (22 years).\\r\\n\\r\\n  These are the emigrants who first went to America from this Parish.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Aurland Parish, January 25th, 1909.\\r\\n                                                         E. P. Juul.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the immigrants mentioned by Reverend Juul are still living\\r\\non Koshkonong. Thus among the children of Erik J. Ytreli (who died\\r\\nin 1892, at the age of 90),[332] Johannes (John E. Johnson) is still\\r\\nliving on the old homestead, two miles east of Utica, and his brother\\r\\nHaakon is living there with him.[333] Simon Gjellum lived two years\\r\\nin Chicago, then entered the Mexican War, after which he came to\\r\\nKoshkonong. Ivar I. Ytreli[334] had been a school teacher and deacon at\\r\\nSystrond, in which capacity he continued serving here in this country,\\r\\nat Rock Prairie, Rock County, whither he went soon after arriving in\\r\\nWisconsin; he died there about 1875. Of other immigrants from Aurland,\\r\\nwhich Mr. Anders J. Flaam speaks of, I shall mention Peder J. Gjeirsme,\\r\\nand Torbjörn O. Gjeirsme, wife Metta and family, who came in 1846, and\\r\\nHans Torjussen Flom, who, he says, went soon after Ole T. Flom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [332] The family shortened the name to Lie in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [333] During a visit with him at the John E. Johnson homestead last\\r\\n        August I had the pleasure of listening to H. Lie\\'s narrative\\r\\n        of the emigration of this party from Aurland and of their\\r\\n        early experiences. Haakon Lie has a remarkable memory and he\\r\\n        has made it a point to follow the career and keep in touch\\r\\n        with his fellow immigrants of 1845, and their history in this\\r\\n        country. Space does not permit me to give here details from\\r\\n        my interview with him, nor from that with others relative to\\r\\n        the immigration of these years. But I may add that the party\\r\\n        sailed with Kong Sverre, Captain Fisher; they were six weeks\\r\\n        and four days on the way from Bergen to New York, thence\\r\\n        they went by steamboat to Albany, where they arrived on the\\r\\n        fourth of July. Arriving in Chicago one of the last days in\\r\\n        July, they remained there a week then proceeded to their\\r\\n        destination, Koshkonong, driving with oxen from Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Haakon Lie says there were none on the ship from Telemarken or\\r\\n        Numedal; the 300 passengers were all from Sogn and Voss; but\\r\\n        I learn through others that there were some from Hardanger on\\r\\n        the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The limitations of space necessitates curtailment in the account\\r\\n        in nearly every chapter. From the vast amount of material I\\r\\n        have, I can offer here practically only that which pertains\\r\\n        specifically to the history of immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [334] Or, as Kristen Sherpi of West Koshkonong called him in an\\r\\n        interview last summer, Ivar i Heggvikji.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1845 there came also a group of immigrants to\\r\\nKoshkonong from Vik Parish, namely several families from near\\r\\nArnefjord. This party included several Næset families, the oldest\\r\\nliving survivor of which is Jens J. Næset (b. 1828), well-known\\r\\nKoshkonong architect, who resides at Stoughton, Wisconsin.[335] I have\\r\\nhad several interviews with Mr. Næset relative to their sailing, and\\r\\ntheir early life as pioneers; it will be possible to give here only\\r\\nthe briefest facts. Jens Næset tells me that there were eight estates\\r\\nat Næset and that the owners of four of them sold out at the same time\\r\\nand went to America. The biggest of these estates was that of Ingebrigt\\r\\nNæset, or as he was usually called, Skuungen. In the party were Jens\\r\\nNæset\\'s parents, Johannes Jensen Næset and wife Eli, his oldest sister\\r\\nGro, married to Ole Larson (Haugan)[336] who is living in Cambridge,\\r\\nWisconsin, two brothers Ingebrigt and John, and another sister who\\r\\nlater married Henrik Lien of East Koshkonong.[337]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [335] Jens Næset, I have just learned, died at Stoughton last week,\\r\\n        May, 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [336] They had one child when they came; she is Mrs. Ole Venaas,\\r\\n        Rockdale, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [337] Johannes Næset was born in Feios, but his father had bought\\r\\n        Næset in 1823 and settled there, three Norwegian miles from\\r\\n        Arnefjord.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three ships that sailed at the same time, Næset relates. One\\r\\nof these was the _Kong Sverre_, Captain Fischer (of which Haakon Lie\\r\\nspeaks above), and on which the emigrants from Aurland were embarked.\\r\\nAnother was a two-masted sloop, _Peder Schröder_, and which carried\\r\\nabout 130 passengers, among whom the Næset families; this sloop had\\r\\ncrossed twice before. The third was one commanded by Captain Brock. The\\r\\npassengers on this ship were mostly from Sogn, but there were three\\r\\nboys from Hardanger, and a few persons from Voss. _Peder Schröder_ also\\r\\ncarried emigrants principally from Sogn, but there were two from Voss,\\r\\nsays Næset. One of these was Brynjulf Leland, who settled at Norway\\r\\nGrove, where he is still living. The other was Odd Himle, whom we have\\r\\nmet with above page 168, as the guide of the first party of explorers\\r\\nof Koshkonong in 1839. He had returned to Norway in 1844, married there\\r\\nin 1845, and was now returning to America. Among those who came on the\\r\\nBrock-ship were Skuungen and Ole Menes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recognize in Captain Brook\\'s ship the same ship that Lasse Ellingson\\r\\nof Capron, Illinois, came on in 1845. It was furthermore the very\\r\\nsame voyage of this ship. The name of the ship was _Albion_. For a\\r\\npartial list of the passengers on this ship as of _Peder Schröder_,\\r\\nwhose captain was Vingaard,[338] the reader may now be referred to the\\r\\naccount of the sailing of these two ships above, Chapter XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [338] The much talked of Vingaard-ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ships _Kong Sverre_ and _Peder Schröder_ sailed side by side\\r\\nthe whole way, relates Næset, _Kong Sverre_ arriving in New York in\\r\\nthe evening, _Peder Schröder_ the next morning. Captain Brock\\'s ship\\r\\nwhich had started ten days earlier, arrived three days later (see above\\r\\npage 275). From New York the immigrants were taken over the usual route\\r\\nto Milwaukee.[339] Having arrived in Muskego, they secured Halvor\\r\\nLuraas to take their goods to Koshkonong; he brought them to Clinton\\r\\n(Rockdale), where the first man they met was Torstein Selseng, who\\r\\nhad emigrated from Aurland, Sogn, to Koshkonong the preceding year.\\r\\nJohannes Næset, who was a man of considerable means for the time,\\r\\nbought the land, which is now occupied by the son Ingebrigt Næset,\\r\\nwhich is section thirty-five in the southeastern part of Christiana\\r\\nTownship.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [339] Mr. Næset\\'s full account of this journey I shall publish\\r\\n        elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohannes Næset was born in Leikanger Parish in 1795; his wife,\\r\\nEli I. Berdahl, was born in 1797. She died in Koshkonong in 1850,\\r\\nJohannes died in 1882. He was noted for his ability as a mechanic, was\\r\\nsuccessful as a maker of violins, and was himself a capable player.\\r\\nJens Næset early distinguished himself as a builder and an architect.\\r\\nThough but sixteen years old he assisted in the building of the old log\\r\\nchurch in East Koshkonong in 1844, and it was Næset who took it down\\r\\nagain in 1858 and constructed the old stone church, which a few years\\r\\nago was replaced by a handsome brick edifice. He also built the tower\\r\\nof the old Liberty Prairie Church, and a number of the oldest houses on\\r\\nAlbion Prairie were erected by him. Jens Næset was married in 1850; he\\r\\nhas no children. Mrs. Ole Melaas of Stoughton, Wisconsin, is an adopted\\r\\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Næset.[340]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [340] The Næsets have been living in Stoughton since 1876.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been noted, there was a considerable immigration from Sogndal,\\r\\nSogn, in 1846; to name only a few: Ole C. Teigen, Ellend T. Quale,\\r\\nwith wife Dordei Baardsdatter and family, eight in all, Anders S.\\r\\nHundere, Nils O. Selseng and wife, and Johannes I. Gjerde. From\\r\\nAurland, Sogndal, and Hafslo there came others in the following four\\r\\nyears. I shall here name Peder Sylfestson Aaberge from Hafslo, who\\r\\ncame in 1847, Ole O. Anderson (1848), Ole O. Hemsing (1849), both from\\r\\nSogndal, Atle S. Gjellum and family, Per Sherping and wife Kristine and\\r\\nKristen Olson Gulvangen from Aurland in 1849. Of these Aaberge later\\r\\nmoved to Minnesota. Ole Anderson (often called Skog-Ola) settled three\\r\\nmiles north of Albion, where he lived till his death. He married Guri\\r\\nPederson, adoptive daughter of Torstein Selseng in 1851, who had come\\r\\nto America in 1849. She died in June, 1909. Ole Hemsing located first\\r\\nin Cottage Grove; in 1855 he purchased the old Hemsing farm three miles\\r\\nnorth of Stoughton, later owned by the son Ole H. Hemsing (b. 1853),\\r\\nsince 1884, of Stoughton, Wisconsin. Ole O. Hemsing died about 1895,\\r\\nthe widow (Ragnilda) died in 1907. Per Sherping died early and the\\r\\nwidow married Kristen Olson, who then took the name Sherping (Sherpi).\\r\\nKristen Sherpi (b. 1823) is still living at the old homestead near West\\r\\nKoshkonong Church. There was scattered immigration from Telemarken\\r\\ndown to 1850, especially from Hvideseid, about forty in all came from\\r\\nHallingdal, and twenty-five from Hardanger; Valders, Ringsaker, Biri\\r\\nand Vardal, and a dozen other provinces and parishes are represented\\r\\nby four or five settlers each. The first to arrive from Hardanger were\\r\\nSvend L. Lund, Ingebrekt, Nicolai, and Johannes Erdahl, Guttorm Buo,\\r\\nOle L. and Aslak E. Quammen; these came in 1847. From Ringsaker came\\r\\nAnders J. Tömmerstigen, wife Maria Olsdatter and children Johannes,\\r\\nOlive, Peter (b. 1843) and Karen Marie, in 1846, while from North\\r\\nAurdal in Valders came Ole Loe and Ole H. Hippe, both with families,\\r\\nand from Slidre, Tollef H. Gvale, all in 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall now offer a copy of the official register of members of the\\r\\nKoshkonong churches during this period, according to the Parochial\\r\\nRecords left by Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson for the years 1844 to\\r\\n1850. This is here printed for the first time and will be read with\\r\\nconsiderable interest by the many descendants of the founders of these\\r\\ntwo historic congregations on Koshkonong Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n      _\"Kirkeregister.\" Church Register of the East Koshkonong,\\r\\n                  West Koshkonong and Liberty Prairie\\r\\n                Congregations as Constituted During the\\r\\n                Years of Reverend J.

The first Norwegian in this section was Svennung\\r\\nNikkulson Dahle, who came from Flatdal in Telemarken in 1844 to\\r\\nKoshkonong, and the next year purchased land and settled near Norway\\r\\nGrove in the Town of Vienna. He was then only eighteen years old.[360]\\r\\nNearly all who came later were from Sogn, and Dahle was and remained\\r\\nthe only native of Telemarken in Vienna. In 1846 Erik Engesæter, from\\r\\nLeikanger, Sogn, with family, including a son John, settled there. In\\r\\n1847 Ole H. Farness (b. 1826) and wife Gertrude came from Sogn, Norway,\\r\\nto Norway Grove. Erik C. Farness[361] (b. 1828) also came the same\\r\\nyear. These men both acquired large farms there in the course of time,\\r\\nOle Farness owning 530 acres. Arne Boyum and family, five in all, from\\r\\nOuter Sogn, came in 1848 as did Knut K. Naas (b. 1810), with wife Alau\\r\\nand family of four children from Kragerö.[362]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [360] About 1858 he married Maline Öien (b. in Aardal, Sogn, in\\r\\n        1835). Svennung Dahle died in 1872, the owner of 400 acres of\\r\\n        land.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [361] He was married to Ingeborg Grinde in 1851, Rev. A. C. Preus\\r\\n        performing the ceremony. Ingeborg was the daughter of Botolf\\r\\n        Grinde who came from Sogn in 1846 and settled on Liberty\\r\\n        Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [362] Two sons, Thomas and Isak, went to the War in 1860. Thomas\\r\\n        was killed in the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862.\\r\\n        Knut Naas died in 1868; his wife in 1887.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian to buy land in Windsor Township was Ingebrigt\\r\\nLarson Tygum, from Systrand, Sogn, who immigrated in 1844, lived one\\r\\nyear in Muskego, then came to Windsor in 1845. For two years he seems\\r\\nto have been the only Norwegian in the Town.[363] In 1852 Tygum sold\\r\\nhis farm in Windsor and moved into Vienna Township, buying the farm\\r\\nat present occupied by the son Lars (b. 1849). In 1847 the following\\r\\nsettled in Windsor Township: Stephen Holum and family, who had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1845 and lived two years at Rock Prairie, Sjur Grinde\\r\\nand family, and Truls E. Farness and wife.[364] These families are\\r\\nintimately connected with the history of the Village of De Forest. A\\r\\nson of S. Holum, namely Ole S. Holum (b. 1847), lives on 204 acres\\r\\nof land adjoining the village. Ole Holum is a prominent democrat and\\r\\nhas held various offices of trust, being e. g. Register of Deeds in\\r\\n1877-78.[365] In 1848 several families moved in, among them Lars\\r\\nEggum, Ole Haukness and family (ten in all), and Sjur S. Vangness and\\r\\nfamily. Vangness had immigrated in 1844, first settled in Rock County,\\r\\nthen came to De Forest in 1848. He died there in 1878. The family\\r\\nincluded a son, Sjur S. Vangness (b. 1816 at Vangsness in Sogn), whom\\r\\nwe meet with later as a man of much influence in the township; he owned\\r\\n264 acres of land near De Forest.[366]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [363] Larson married Brita (Dale) widow of Jon Eiken on Rock\\r\\n        Prairie in 1847; she died in 1902, aged 89.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [364] Farness came from Balestrand Parish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [365] Farness died in 1885, his wife died in 1902 at the home of\\r\\n        her daughter, Mrs. H. T. Lerdall, Madison, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [366] As I shall not have occasion elsewhere to speak of the\\r\\n        Township of Burke directly south of Windsor, I may here say\\r\\n        that the first Norwegian settlers were Torkel Gullikson\\r\\n        (b. 1815) and wife Margarete, whom he had married in 1843;\\r\\n        they came to Pleasant Spring in 1844 and moved up to Burke\\r\\n        the following year. For several years there came no more\\r\\n        Norwegians.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bristol Township three families settled as early as 1846; namely\\r\\nthat of Botolf E. Bergum (b. 1816), who came there in the fall of 1846,\\r\\nand continued to reside there until his death in 1904 (his wife died\\r\\nin 1903; after a wedded life of fifty-four years),[367] Sjur Johnson\\r\\nand wife Ingeborg and one son, and Erik Larson and wife and several\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [367] They left five sons: Erik, Ellik, Peter, who live on Spring\\r\\n        Prairie, Marcus (Deerfield), and John, who lives in Cottage\\r\\n        Grove, and one daughter, Mrs. Peter Hagen, Spring Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1848 Hans H. Quamme came up to Bristol from Rock Prairie, where he\\r\\nhad settled in 1846, coming from Norway that year. During the next\\r\\nthree years so many immigrants came from Sogn and located in Norway\\r\\nGrove that the settlement came to be called \"Sogn.\" Among the many\\r\\nfamilies who located there at that time, John Ollis of Madison,\\r\\nWisconsin, writing in _Bygdejaevining_, page 341, names: \"Engesæther,\\r\\nGrinde, Farnes, Tygum, Eggum, Boyum, Huseböe, Hamre, Ohnstad, Slinde,\\r\\nSværen, Vangsness, Holum, Linde, Lidahl, Thorsnes, Fosse, Rendahl,\\r\\nEthun, Vigdahl, Ulvestad, Röisum, Svalem, Fjerstad, Henjum, Jerde,\\r\\nHaukeness,\" besides all who were called Olson, Larson, Nilson,\\r\\nAnderson, Peterson, Johnson, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten miles northwest of Norway Grove, at Lodi in Columbia County,\\r\\na smaller settlement of immigrants from Hardanger takes its beginning\\r\\nin 1847-48; although one family had settled there as early as 1844.\\r\\nIn that year Peder L. Ödvin (b. 1819) and wife Kathrine Spaanem, from\\r\\nUlvik in Hardanger, emigrated to America and went direct to Lodi. Ten\\r\\nyears later they moved to Springdale in Dane County.[368] In 1847 Peder\\r\\nFröland (see page 336) and Ole Jone, both from Hardanger, became the\\r\\nfounders of the Hardanger Settlement there. In 1846 Ammund Himle and\\r\\nfamily from Voss immigrated and settled near Lodi, but below the Dane\\r\\nCounty line.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [368] Peder Ödvin and wife returned to Norway in 1893 to spend\\r\\n        their declining days at Hardanger; Mrs. Ödvin died there\\r\\n        in 1895. In 1902 the son, L. P. Ödvin, visited his father\\r\\n        in Norway and brought him back to his home in Verona, Dane\\r\\n        County, where he died in 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the Spring Prairie Settlement in Columbia County, the\\r\\nnorthern extremity of which is more specifically called Bonnet Prairie,\\r\\ndates back to 1845. In that year four men settled about the same time\\r\\non Spring Prairie, namely: Odd Himle and Sjur S. Reque from Voss,\\r\\nAnders Langeteig from Vik in Sogn, and Knud Langeland from Racine\\r\\nCounty. The three first of these had families. Reque moved away again\\r\\nfour years later, settling on Liberty Prairie, not far from Deerfield.\\r\\nLangeland, as we have recited above, was already in 1848 back in Racine\\r\\nCounty as one of the founders of _Nordlyset_, the first Norwegian\\r\\nnewspaper published in this country; but Himle and Langeteig became\\r\\npermanent settlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book _Nordmaendene i Amerika_ Langeland gives a circumstantial\\r\\naccount of his coming to Spring Prairie. He says that in August of\\r\\n1845 he and Niels Torstensen, equipping themselves with a cook stove,\\r\\nprovisions, bedding, and all the necessities for camping out, drove\\r\\nwith oxen and a wagon from Racine via Koshkonong, following the regular\\r\\nroad to Madison (presumably going by West Koshkonong Church). But\\r\\nMadison did not attract them. He says: \"Madison had nothing remarkable\\r\\nabout it except its natural beauty and the big Territorial Building,\\r\\nwhich looked very imposing among the small frame houses.\" These sons\\r\\nof the land of mountains \"were scared away by the big hills\" where the\\r\\nUniversity is now situated, and turned east, driving almost as far\\r\\nas Fort Winnebago, where Amund Rosseland, a friend of Langeland\\'s,\\r\\nfrom Norway, had recently settled. Not finding the marshes here very\\r\\ninviting, and failing to meet Rosseland at home, they decided to turn\\r\\nback. Camping out over night, they drove back twenty miles the next\\r\\nday; then upon the advice of an American by the name of Young, they\\r\\nturned east, and driving on a few miles, came upon an American by the\\r\\nname of Gilbert, who was just engaged in erecting his log hut. The\\r\\nprairie here was to their liking and they selected a site and in due\\r\\ntime entered a claim on land.\\r\\n\\r\\nLangeland says there came no other Norwegians there that fall, but as\\r\\nwe have seen, three others did locate in other parts of the prairie,\\r\\nabout the time Langeland came there. That same fall Langeland went to\\r\\nMilwaukee to take out pre-emption papers and he stopped at Koshkonong,\\r\\nand told his countrymen there of the beauties of the prairies to the\\r\\nnorth, and a little later he wrote letters to friends in La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois. From Milwaukee he says he brought back to Spring\\r\\nPrairie with him a plow, a harrow, and other farm tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1846 Peder Fröland[369] came up there from La Salle\\r\\nCounty, bringing with him two ox-teams and a wagon and farm tools,\\r\\nbut he seems to have been the only one who came from La Salle County;\\r\\na number of settlers, however, came from Boone County and Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie to Spring and Bonnet Prairie in 1847-1850. In June, 1846,\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants began to come in hosts from or via Koshkonong,\\r\\nsays Langeland. He and Fröland plowed about one hundred acres of\\r\\nprairie land for the newcomers that season. Two years later Langeland\\r\\nsold his claim and moved back to Racine County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [369] Who had come to America in 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it happened that also Spring Prairie became settled largely from\\r\\nKoshkonong, and as this was the period in which immigration from Sogn\\r\\nwas taking place on a large scale, it was especially Sognings who\\r\\ntook possession also of this region; though a considerable number of\\r\\nVossings also gradually moved in. Reverend L. S. J. Reque writes me\\r\\nthat Spring Prairie is today almost exclusively a Sogning-Vossing\\r\\nsettlement, and the former predominate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spring Prairie Settlement, whose beginnings have here been briefly\\r\\nsketched, rapidly expanded north to Bonnet Prairie, this part of it\\r\\ncoming to be known as the Bonnet Prairie Settlement. The settlement\\r\\nis located principally in Otsego Township, but partly in Hampdon and\\r\\nsurrounding towns. The first Norwegian settlers in this locality were\\r\\nJohn Anderson and Kjel Anderson, who came in 1846, having immigrated\\r\\nfrom Saude, Telemarken, that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of the founders of the settlement as submitted\\r\\nto me by Samuel Sampson of Rio, Wisconsin. Mr. Sampson (b. 1839) is the\\r\\nonly survivor of those who settled there at that time, being the son of\\r\\nThorbjörn Skutle. The year to the right of each name indicates the year\\r\\nof immigration to America. All except the last two settled at Bonnet\\r\\nPrairie in 1846; these two settled there in 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Name_                          _Wife_         _Where from_\\r\\n\\r\\n  John Anderson                     Anne           Saude       1844\\r\\n  Kjel Anderson                     Ingebor        Saude       1844\\r\\n  Hans Jörgensen Kjösvik            Kari           Holden      1847\\r\\n  Peter Halvorson Valöen            Kirsti         Holden      1846\\r\\n  Augon Aarness                     Ingeborg       Saude       1843\\r\\n  Leif Johnson Dahle                Liv Marie      Saude       1843\\r\\n  Tollef Olson Hawkos               Ingebor        Bö          1846\\r\\n  Iver Vangen                       Martha         Aurland     1844\\r\\n  Gunleik Olson Svalestuen          Ingebor        Saude       1844\\r\\n  Knut Gunnelson Tveten             Margit         Numedal     1844\\r\\n  Even Tostenson Indlæggen          Guro           Saude       1844\\r\\n  Hans Hawkos Aase                  Anna           Bö          1846\\r\\n  Hans Tollefson                    Helene         Saude       1846\\r\\n  Johannes Frondal                  Ragnild        Aurland     1845\\r\\n  Eilif Olson                       Johanne        Sogn        1845\\r\\n  Mikkel Knutson                                   Sogn        1845\\r\\n  Johannes Johanneson Gvaale        Kari           Saude       1845\\r\\n  Halvor Shelby                     Ingri          Saude       1848\\r\\n  Thorbjörn Sampson Skutle          Anna           Voss        1848\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the above was written I have received from Reverend L. S. J.\\r\\nReque of Morrisonville, Wisconsin, further facts relative to the\\r\\nearliest settlers there. The earliest records of the Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nChurch kept by Reverend A. C. Preus show that the testimonial of\\r\\nemigration was issued to \"Eivind T. Indlæggen.\" April 5, 1843, to\\r\\n\"Johannes Johannesen\" April 10th, 1843, to John Anderson and wife\\r\\nMay 3d and 6th, 1843, to \"Hans Olsen Haukaas\" May 7th, 1843. Also to\\r\\n\"Thorbjörn Samsonsen and wife Anna Ellingsdatter\" May 13th, 1844.\\r\\nAs it is probable that these emigrated at the time of issue of the\\r\\ntestimonial of emigration the table should be corrected with reference\\r\\nto these names. During the intervening three years most of the above\\r\\nhad lived in Boone County, Illinois, whither also some of the later\\r\\nsettlers came en route to Bonnet Prairie. Thorbjörn Skutle and family\\r\\nwho came from Voss, sailing on the ship _Hercules_, located first at\\r\\nJefferson Prairie. T. Skutle and his wife both died in 1897, age 88 and\\r\\n91 respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _Blue Mounds in Western Dane County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extensive Norwegian settlement in Western Dane County, ordinarily\\r\\nreferred to as Blue Mounds from the \"blue mounds\" in the township of\\r\\nthat name, was founded in 1846. Three families had, however, located\\r\\nthere as early as 1844, namely those of Thor Aase, Peder Dusterud,\\r\\nand Lars P. Dusterud. Thor Aase, with wife Martha, five sons and two\\r\\ndaughters,[370] settled on section ten in Springdale; they came from\\r\\nSogn in 1843 and had lived one year at Wiota. Peder Dusterud and wife\\r\\nand family settled on section 33 in Blue Mounds and the son Lars\\r\\nDusterud and wife located on section 27, both in Blue Mounds Township.\\r\\nThese two came from Rock Run, Illinois, where they had located in 1842,\\r\\nimmigrating from Vægli, Numedal.[371] They had also worked for some\\r\\ntime in the Dodgeville, Wis., lead mines.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [370] The children were Ivar (b. 1818), Lasse, Hermund, Talak,\\r\\n        John, Synneva, and Britha.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [371] Lars Dusterud and wife are still living at Mt. Horeb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 a company of eleven persons arrived from Racine County; they\\r\\nwere the following: Tore Toreson Spaanem, Halvor and Nils H. Grasdalen,\\r\\nJohn I. Berge and wife Julia and one child, his sister Mrs. Knut\\r\\nSörenson Kvisterud, Tosten Thompson Rue, Ole T. Garden, Ole Kvisterud,\\r\\nand Ole Sjutvett. Knut S. Kvisterud, who had just before this gone to\\r\\nMineral Point and secured work there, came to Blue Mounds in 1848. John\\r\\nThompson later was more generally called \"Snow-shoe Thompson\" from the\\r\\nfact that he carried the U. S. mail over the Sierra Nevada Mountains\\r\\nfor twenty years (1856-1876), walking on _skis_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these came from Muskego, Wisconsin, whither they had immigrated\\r\\nfrom Tin, Telemarken. Spaanem and Halvor Grasdalen had come there in\\r\\n1841, Knut Kvisterud and wife in 1843, and Berge in 1845. The Rue\\r\\nfamily had come from Norway, as we have seen, in 1839 (see above page\\r\\n125). In 1846 the Town of Primrose, immediately south of Springdale,\\r\\nalso received its first Norwegian settlers, namely, Christian\\r\\nHendrickson, wife Maria and three children, Caroline, Henry, and\\r\\nCharles. He had emigrated from Lier, Norway, in 1842, and worked four\\r\\nyears in the lead mines at Wiota to pay his passage from Norway. Mr.\\r\\nHendrickson drove from Wiota to Primrose with oxen, all his possessions\\r\\nbeing then a wagon, a cow, and seventy-five cents. He lived eight years\\r\\nin the log hut first erected and built a stone structure in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next arrivals to Blue Mounds were Erik Solvi, who came from Sogn in\\r\\n1847, and lived successively in Springdale, Vermont, and Blue Mounds,\\r\\nand Gullik Svensrud and family from Vægli, Numedal, who had immigrated\\r\\nin 1844,[372] and first located on Rock Prairie. It was also in 1847\\r\\nthat the first immigrant from Valders arrived in Blue Mounds; this was\\r\\nRagnild Fadnes who in 1851 married Ever Halsten. She was born in North\\r\\nAurdal in 1826; as near as I am able to determine she was the only\\r\\nmember of the family who came at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [372] The party with which they came left Drammen April 20th and\\r\\n        landed at Quebec June 20th; they arrived at Rock Prairie on\\r\\n        July 4th. The family included several children; a daughter\\r\\n        Gunhild (b. 1837), married Halvor Halvorson of Mt. Horeb in\\r\\n        1856.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1846-1847 other localities, Wiota, Western Koshkonong, Spring\\r\\nPrairie and Norway Grove had claimed a considerable portion of the\\r\\nimmigrants. But in 1848 they began to come in in large numbers in\\r\\nthe townships of western Dane County and neighboring parts of Iowa\\r\\nCounty. To Primrose the following came in that year: Nils Skogen,\\r\\nSalve Jörgenson, and Nils Einarson. To Perry: Ole O. Bakken and wife\\r\\nAnne (Bergum) and two sons (Ole and Tideman) from Valders. This was\\r\\nthe first Norwegian family to locate permanently in Perry; Bakken\\r\\nbought the claim of a \"squatter\" named Andreas Olson, who was therefore\\r\\nthe earliest Norwegian in the township. Later in the same year came\\r\\nLars Langemyr from Christiania, Norway, Torger T. Tvedt from Aamli\\r\\nin Nedenæs, Reiar Aarhus from Telemarken, Halvor O. Milesten from\\r\\nHadeland, and Lars Halvorson and Hans Johnson from Drangedal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrivals of 1848 were Ole Barton, wife Ingeborg and son Ole,\\r\\nGulbrand Elseberg,[373] wife Ingeborg and two daughters, Christian O.\\r\\nSkogen, Ole O. Braaten and Nils O. Belgum; and in 1849: Knud Larson,\\r\\nAnders Lundene, Iver Halstein, Iver Lund, Ole Jelle, Sr., and Tore\\r\\nMaanem, all of whom were from Valders, mostly from North Aurdal.\\r\\nTollef S. Anmarksrud and wife Karen came to Koshkonong the latter\\r\\nyear, but he also removed to Blue Mounds in 1850. During the next few\\r\\nyears immigration to the various townships of western Dane County was\\r\\nrapid. For the fall of 1849 and in 1850 are to be mentioned, e. g.\\r\\nthe following arrivals in Springdale Township: Harald and Arne Hoff,\\r\\nOle and Aslak Lee, Levor Lien, Ole Thompson Brenden, Anders, John and\\r\\nKnut Lunde, Knut J. Lindelien, Harald Stugaard, Michel Kolskett and\\r\\nErik O. Skinrud; several of these had large families. To Blue Mounds\\r\\nTownship came: Erik Engen, Ole Boley, wife and four children, and Arne\\r\\nRöste, with family of eleven children; all those named here came from\\r\\nValders.[374]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [373] Elseberg not long afterwards started for Manitowoc to visit\\r\\n        a brother, who had just come there, and was never heard from\\r\\n        again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [374] Boley and Röste were from South Aurdal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Sogn came Ole A. Grinde and Ole Menes, the latter remaining,\\r\\nhowever, two years in Norway Grove before coming to Blue Mounds.\\r\\nMichael Johnson (b. 1832 in Leikanger, Norway) emigrated to America\\r\\nin 1853, located first in Windsor, then removed to Vienna, finally\\r\\nsettled permanently in Springdale in 1856. His parents, Jon Michelson\\r\\nDahlbotten and wife Randi, and his sister Martha[375] and younger\\r\\nbrother Botolf came to America in 1854. Mr. Johnson became a\\r\\nprosperous farmer and stock-raiser, his farm of 400 acres being one of\\r\\nthe finest in that part of the state. He took an active part in church\\r\\nand school affairs and was for many years a member of the governing\\r\\nbody (Kirkeraad) of the Norwegian Lutheran Evangelical Synod of\\r\\nAmerica. He held many positions of trust in the town and the county,\\r\\nwas a member of the State Legislature for three consecutive terms,\\r\\n1874-75-76, and for years a well-known figure in the politics of the\\r\\nstate. Mr. Johnson lived in Mt. Horeb since 1894; he died in 1908,\\r\\nleaving a widow and seven children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [375] Martha married Ole O. Flom in 1854. Botolf is B. J. Borlaug,\\r\\n        well-known capitalist and banker of Kenyon, Minnesota. The\\r\\n        family had moved from Aurland to Borlang in Feios, Leikanger\\r\\n        Parish, where the children were all born.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Primrose and Perry the Norwegians also settled extensively in\\r\\n1849-1850. Among those who arrived in the former year were Gunnuf and\\r\\nOle Tollefsen from Sæltersdalen, who as we have seen above, page 281,\\r\\nhad immigrated to Muskego in 1845. Others who came to Primrose that\\r\\nyear were G. and Ole Danielson[376] from Telemarken, Leif Olson, Kittil\\r\\nMoland, Ole Anderson and Peter P. Haslerud. Tollefson relates how he\\r\\nbecame the possessor of his quarter section in Primrose as follows:[377]\\r\\n\\r\\n  As I wished to own land of my own as soon as possible, I went to\\r\\n  Primrose in 1849. Here I met Niels Einarson. There was enough\\r\\n  of land, but how to get the number of what I selected, was the\\r\\n  question. After much search we found a large oak a short distance\\r\\n  east from where Norman Randal lives. On this tree was clearly to be\\r\\n  seen the following letters and numbers: N. W. ¼, S. 23, T. 5, N.\\r\\n  R. 6 E. There was neither pen nor paper to get without going many\\r\\n  miles, and something had to be done at once. I borrowed an axe of\\r\\n  Emerson, cut down a little poplar, and, after having cut it flat on\\r\\n  both sides, so that it became quite thin, I took my pocket knife\\r\\n  and cut into it the letters and numbers just as they were in the\\r\\n  tree. With this poplar stuck under my arm I went to the land-office\\r\\n  and laid the stick and the money on the table, to the official\\'s\\r\\n  amusement. They understood the description and I got the land.[378]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [376] Ole Danielson had lived in Illinois since he came from Norway\\r\\n        in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [377] The citation is from Langeland, page 73.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [378] Tollefson says that at Clinton he worked for a Mr. Sherwood a\\r\\n        while; he cut 600 rails for the loan of the latter\\'s oxen and\\r\\n        wagon with which to bring his parents from Muskego to Rock\\r\\n        County.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1850 came Mrs. Ole Baker with son P. O. Baker (b. 1838), Mons\\r\\nNess, Elling Stamn, Ole Skuldt and Lars Halvorson from Hallingdal,\\r\\nKnut and Jens Olson from Stavanger, Lars L. Kolve and family from Voss\\r\\nand Knut Baardson (Bowerson) and family from Sætersdalen. During 1853\\r\\nto 1855 Norwegians came in still greater numbers, writes Reverend\\r\\nHöverstad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout twenty Norwegians settled in Perry in 1849; they were: Torger\\r\\nHastvedt, Hans J. Dahle, Ole Gangsei and Jacob Aanhus from Telemarken,\\r\\nAndreas Stutelien and Jul Haavernd, wife and eight children from\\r\\nValders, and Anders Sanderson from Hallingdal. After 1849 Norwegians\\r\\ncame in in large numbers, settling up the town rapidly.[379] I shall\\r\\nmention here only Onon Björnson Dahle (b. 1823) from Nissedal, who\\r\\nsettled in Perry in 1853, and Christian Evanson (b. 1819) from Valders,\\r\\nand wife Ragnild from Numedal, who came there in 1854.[380] Dr. Evans\\r\\ntells me that Ragnild Evanson (maiden name Ragnild Brekke) was born in\\r\\nNumedal, Norway, in 1819, and after her marriage to Christian Evanson,\\r\\nimmigrated to America in company with her brother Lars N. Brekke (who\\r\\nfor many years resided and conducted a grocery store in Madison, Wis.)\\r\\nin the year 1848, preceding her husband by about five years. They\\r\\ncame by sailing vessel, and were sixteen weeks on the voyage, having\\r\\nbeen grounded on a rock off the coast of England and were obliged to\\r\\nwait repairs. After landing in New York they came by Erie canal and\\r\\nthe lakes to Milwaukee, Wis., then to near Stoughton, Wis., and later\\r\\nto Madison, where she met her husband five years later. From Madison\\r\\nthey moved to Perry, Dane County, and settled on section twenty-three\\r\\nand remained there until their death.[381] O. B. Dahle, who had been\\r\\na school teacher in Nissedal, left Norway in company with a cousin,\\r\\nKnut Dahl, in 1848. They first came to Koshkonong, where the former\\r\\ntaught parochial school for two years. They went to California in 1850\\r\\nin search of gold as so many others. Having been unusually successful\\r\\nin the gold mines, they returned in 1853, and Onon Dahle bought a farm\\r\\nin Perry, on which he founded the village of Daleyville, beginning at\\r\\nthe same time there a mercantile business. Here he amassed a fortune,\\r\\nretired and moved to Mt. Horeb in 1897. In 1854 Dahle married Betsey\\r\\nNelson, daughter of Hermo N. Tufte of Racine County, and sister of\\r\\nthe well-known lay evangelist, Elling Eielson. Mr. Dahle always took\\r\\nan active interest in public affairs and in the work of the Lutheran\\r\\nChurch of which he is a member. He died in July, 1905, his wife having\\r\\ndied in February of the same year.[382]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [379] Among them were Knut Grimstvedt and Ole Hastvedt from\\r\\n        Telemarken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [380] Jens P. Tyvand (b. 1817) who had emigrated from Sannikedal\\r\\n        in 1843 to Lisbon, Ill., and removed to Stoughton, Wis., in\\r\\n        1847, settling in Pleasant Spring, located in Perry in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [381] Mrs. Evanson died in 1894 and Mr. Evanson in 1897, survived\\r\\n        by two children, Anne and Niels (Dr. N. E. Evans of Mt.\\r\\n        Horeb). C. Evanson was a successful farmer, owning 279 acres\\r\\n        of land; he also conducted a store at Perry after 1874.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [382] They left four children: H. B. Dahle, one time member of\\r\\n        Congress, J. T. Dahle (who died in 1908), Henry L. Dahle, all\\r\\n        of Mt. Horeb, and Mrs. James A. Peterson, Minneapolis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall close this chapter with a word about the first Norwegians\\r\\nin Madison, Wisconsin. It is not until 1850 that Norwegians began to\\r\\nlocate in Madison in considerable numbers. However, there were a few\\r\\nthere before that. As near as I can find out, Ole Torgeson, Ole O.\\r\\nFlom, Ole Lenvick, and Halvor N. Hauge, all of whom came to Madison in\\r\\n1844, were the first Norwegians in Madison. All four of these worked\\r\\nfor a printer by the name of Daniel Holt. Ole Flom, as we have seen,\\r\\nhad come from Norway with his parents that summer in the first party\\r\\nthat left Aurland, Sogn. He remained in Madison till 1847 when he\\r\\nreturned to his father\\'s farm at Door Creek.[383] Halvor Hauge had\\r\\ncome from Norway with his parents in the summer of 1844; the family\\r\\nhad located in the Town of Christiana. Halvor went to California in\\r\\n1848 where he remained several years, returning then to Koshkonong.\\r\\nOle Torgerson had emigrated from Norway in 1844, coming directly\\r\\nto Madison, where he continued to live till his death in 1900. He\\r\\npublished during 1850 there a Norwegian paper in the interests of the\\r\\nWhig party, but as this was not a paying enterprise he sold his types\\r\\nto Knut Langeland, who soon after began the issue of _Maanedstidende_\\r\\nin Janesville, having previously published _Nordlyset_ and _Demokraten_\\r\\nin Muskego. Among other Norwegians in Madison in the early days\\r\\nwere: Anne Vik, who worked for Dr. Collins during 1845;[384] in 1846\\r\\nshe married Halvor Bjoin, a Koshkonong pioneer. In July, 1846, Hans\\r\\nChristianson from Lærdal, Sogn, came to Madison; he, however, soon\\r\\nremoved to Blooming Grove, where he located permanently.[385] Halvor\\r\\nGabriel immigrated from Haugesund in 1848, coming direct to Madison,\\r\\nwhere he continued to live until 1877; he then moved to Sun Prairie and\\r\\nin 1893 to Fort Atkinson, where he died in 1897. Among the subscribers\\r\\nto _Nordlyset_ and _Demokraten_, 1848-1850, appear the names of three\\r\\nresidents of Madison, namely: Eric Anderson,[386] Lars Johnson, and\\r\\nWilliam Anderson. Finally, when the Bethel Congregation was organized\\r\\nin 1855 the following appear as charter members: Ole Torgerson, Mrs.\\r\\nOle Torgerson, Hans Olsen, Mr. Erickson, Olaf Olson, Haakon Larson,\\r\\nNels Peterson, Lars Nelson, Ole Lawrence, Halle Steensland, Eline Hoel,\\r\\nAnne Nilson, Ingeborg Olson and Anne Olson. Lars Nelson (Brekke) had\\r\\ncome there in 1848 from Numedal,[387] coming direct to Madison. Mr.\\r\\nNelson was well and favorably known as the owner of a grocery store on\\r\\nWest Main Street for many years. Of the other persons mentioned above\\r\\nonly Haakon Larson and Halle Steensland are now living. The latter has\\r\\nalways held a prominent place in the financial history of the capital\\r\\nand in general in the upbuilding of the city. He has always been a\\r\\nstaunch member of the Bethel Church, and was one of the leaders in the\\r\\norganization of the Norwegian-American Pioneer Association, of which he\\r\\nwas president in 1903-05.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [383] Flom was with Dr. Collins during 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [384] As we have seen, Knud Langeland and Niels Torstenson passed\\r\\n        through Madison in 1845.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [385] He died there a few years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [386] Erik Anderson had come to America with his parents in 1839\\r\\n        and lived in Chicago till 1845 (see p. 232). Then they moved\\r\\n        to McHenry County, Illinois. In 1847 Erik went to Muskego,\\r\\n        where he engaged as compositor in the office of _Nordlyset_,\\r\\n        setting the type for the first number. In 1848 he went to\\r\\n        Madison and began clerking in a general store. He settled as\\r\\n        a farmer in Winneshiek County, Iowa, in 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [387] See page 346 above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\n              _The Hardanger Settlement in Lee and De Kalb\\r\\n                Counties, Illinois. Big Grove in Kendall\\r\\n                       County and Nettle Creek in\\r\\n                       Grundy County, Illinois._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Hardanger has contributed a relatively small proportion of\\r\\nthe American immigrant population from Norway, several of the earliest\\r\\narrivals were from that province and its sons occupy today a prominent\\r\\nplace in Norwegian American history. It has been shown above, chapters\\r\\nIX and X, that several members of the party who came in 1836, as\\r\\nalso of that of 1837, were natives of Hardanger; and in the Chicago\\r\\ncolony in 1839 we met with several natives of that province. In 1839\\r\\na considerable number left Hardanger, especially from Ulvik Parish,\\r\\nas we learn from _Nordmandsforbundet_, 1909, page 175. Among these\\r\\nwere the brothers Anders and Johan Vik from Eidfjord in Hardanger. The\\r\\ntwo brothers first went to Wiota, where they secured work in the lead\\r\\nmines. In 1844 John Vik (Week) went to Dodgeville, where he established\\r\\nhimself as a shoemaker, entering into partnership with Johan Lee from\\r\\nNumedal. Later he went to Portage County, Wisconsin, where he prospered\\r\\nand was for over a decade a dominant power in the lumber trade of\\r\\nnorthern Wisconsin.[388]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [388] These facts gathered from an article by L. J. Erdall in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ for September 18, 1901. The brother, Anders Vik\\r\\n        (Andrew Week), went to California in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants who had come from Hardanger, Parish of Ullensvang,\\r\\nin 1836, we mentioned Ammund Helgeson Maakestad above, page 95.\\r\\nMaakestad dropped the family name in this country and called himself\\r\\nOmmon Hilleson. For a little over a year he was a coast sailor; then he\\r\\ndecided to go west and secure land where his countrymen had settled.\\r\\nThis he did, but not in the usual way, for Hilleson walked the whole\\r\\ndistance from New York to Chicago. This was in 1837.[389]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [389] As Reverend J. Nordby, Lee, Illinois, informs me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Chicago he directed his steps farther west; he did not, however,\\r\\ngo to the settlement founded several years before, but pushed on as far\\r\\nas Lee Center in the County of Lee.[390] Here he secured work, saved\\r\\nsome money, and bought a homestead in Bradford Township, and erected\\r\\nthereon a sod house. Soon after he married Catherine Reinhart, daughter\\r\\nof a German pioneer, recently moved in.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [390] Strand relates an experience which Hilleson had between Chicago\\r\\n        and Lee Center and which would seem to indicate that he had\\r\\n        intended to go to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten years Hilleson was the only Norwegian settler in the county,\\r\\nbut in 1847 there arrived in response to letters from Hilleson, a\\r\\nconsiderable party from Hardanger. These left Sörfjorden in Hardanger,\\r\\nand embarked in May at Bergen in the sailing vessel _Juno_, which\\r\\nbrought them to New York in a little over four weeks, a remarkable\\r\\nrecord for that time.[391] Mr. T. M. Newton (Torgels Knutson) says,\\r\\nwhen we came to Buffalo we met an old man who was returning to Norway.\\r\\nHe advised us to go back at once, saying America was not a fit place\\r\\nfor respectable people to live in, it was a place for thieves and\\r\\nrobbers. The party consisted of the following persons: Lars Larsen\\r\\nRöisetter (Risetter), Lars Olson Espe, Lars Helgeson Maakestad,\\r\\nGjertrud H. Lönning, Helge H. Maaketad (who died in 1854), Ingeborg\\r\\nH. Maakestad, Torgels Knudson Maakestad, Sjur Sjurson Bleie (Bly) and\\r\\nLars Larson Bly. They were met at Chicago by Ommon Hilleson; Lars Bly\\r\\nremained in Chicago, the rest started for Lee County, stopping a short\\r\\ntime at Norway, La Salle County, thereupon all but Ingeborg Maakestad\\r\\ndrove to Hilleson\\'s home in Lee County.[392] Most of them settled in\\r\\nBradford Township, but Lars Risetter (born 1827 in Ullensvang) bought\\r\\neighty acres of land in Sublette Township, whither other subsequent\\r\\nimmigrants from Hardanger also soon moved. Soon after arriving,\\r\\nRisetter and Gjertrud Lönning were married in the first house built by\\r\\na Norwegian in Lee County, at the home of Ommon Hilleson. Lars Espe and\\r\\nLars Risetter were the first two of the party to build a log cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [391] T. M. Newton says the journey took only three weeks; others\\r\\n        say, four. Newton was from Kinservig.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [392] The journey was made with oxen and lumber wagon. Inger Maakestad\\r\\n        remained at Norway for a time; she married Lars Espe soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Newton tells that two young men came from La Salle County about the\\r\\nsame time and bought a piece of land in Franklin Grove about two miles\\r\\nand a half from where he lived. \"They lived in a log cabin on their\\r\\nplace,\" he says. \"One night about two months after we arrived, they\\r\\nwere both murdered. The same day I had tried to persuade one of them to\\r\\nstay with me, but he felt it necessary to be at home. Their heads had\\r\\nbeen split open with an ax. I then thought of what the old gentleman\\r\\nhad tried to tell us and heartily wished myself back in Norway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the years 1848 no immigrants left Hardanger for America, and Lee\\r\\nCounty received no settlers directly from Norway. In 1849, however,\\r\\nthirty-two emigrated from Ulvik, but none of these seem to have come\\r\\nto the settlement. In 1850 there was one accession, namely, Amund\\r\\nLönning, who came directly to his brother-in-law, Lars Risetter, in\\r\\nSublette Township. He worked in the harvest the first season for Thomas\\r\\nFessenden for $11.00 a month, bought a quarter section in Willow Creek\\r\\nTownship in 1852, being the first Norwegian to settle there. In 1857\\r\\nLars Risetter also moved into Willow Creek Township, where he has since\\r\\nlived.[393]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [393] Mrs. Risetter died in 1897; Mr. Risetter is still living. His\\r\\n        two sons, Lewis and Holden, occupy the homestead with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the rest Torgels Maakestad, who adopted the name T. M. Newton\\r\\n(Knutson), is still living, his home being at Grinnell, Iowa. Sjur\\r\\nBleien lives at the Old People\\'s Home, Stoughton, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1851 the following arrived from Ullensvang, Hardanger, and located\\r\\nin the settlement: Jacob O. Rogde (b. 1828), Haaken L. Risetter and\\r\\nwife Maria (Hildal), Haldor Nilsen Hovland, and Agatha Espe, a sister\\r\\nof Lars Espe. Rogde purchased eighty acres of land in Bradford Township\\r\\nin 1854 and in 1855 he married Else Bly from Hardanger, who had come\\r\\nto America in 1854.[394] Haakon Risetter settled in Ogle County\\r\\nimmediately north of Lee County. Of those who arrived in subsequent\\r\\nyears many settled across the county line in De Kalb County, and in a\\r\\nfew years there had sprung up a thriving and prosperous community. At\\r\\npresent the Bradford Norwegian Evangelical Congregation of Lee numbers\\r\\n300 adult members. The center of the settlement is about four miles\\r\\nsouth of Franklin Grove.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [394] C. Christopher of Gruver, Iowa, who has kindly given me many\\r\\n        of the facts relative to the immigration from Hardanger,\\r\\n        names the following as arriving in Lee County in 1854; Lars\\r\\n        N. Rogde and wife Angar W. Sandvæn, Wigleik W. Risetter,\\r\\n        Helle P. Bly and wife Torbjör (Skare), Samson S. Sandvæn and\\r\\n        wife Bægga H. Maakestad. The last three and Lars Rogde died\\r\\n        the same year.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately east of De Kalb and the northern part of La Salle County\\r\\nlies Kendall County, into which extends a northeastern branch of the\\r\\noriginal Fox River Settlement, located chiefly in Big Grove Township;\\r\\nthe village of Newark lies within its boundaries. The first Norwegian\\r\\nto settle in the village of Newark was Ole Olson Hetletvedt, as we have\\r\\nobserved above. Ole Hetletvedt, or Medlepeint as he was called, was\\r\\nborn in August, 1797, and was, as we know, one of the members of the\\r\\nsloop party. Of his first years in this country we have already spoken.\\r\\nHe came to Newark in 1839; there he lived till his death in 1854. The\\r\\nnext settlers in Newark were Herman Osmonson and Knut W. Tysland, both\\r\\nof whom also located there in 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settler at Lisbon was John Hill (Hidle) from\\r\\nFjeldberg in Söndhordland, Norway. He came to America in 1836,[395]\\r\\ngoing direct to La Salle County. Among the immigrants of that year\\r\\nwere also Anders Anderson Aasen and wife Olena and family from Tysvær\\r\\nParish, a little south of Haugesund. The family included a daughter\\r\\nSusanna, (born 1822), who was married to John Hill in 1844. The Aasen\\r\\nfamily lived in Kendall, New York, for two years, then in 1838 moved\\r\\nto La Salle County, Illinois. In 1839 John Hill located at Lisbon, and\\r\\nhe was thus the first Norwegian to settle here, whither a considerable\\r\\nnumber later moved.[396] About 1846 Sjur Larson came there from\\r\\nSkaanevik, Norway; Lars Chelley (Kjelle) came in 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [395] Lars Bö and Michael Bö came at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [396] John Hill died in 1892, but Mrs. Susanne Hill is still living\\r\\n        with her daughter, Mrs. Austin Osmond (b. 1845), in Morris,\\r\\n        Grundy County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegians did not begin to come in extensively to Lisbon before\\r\\n1850. Mrs. Austin Osmond, oldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Hill,\\r\\nwho is now living in Morris, Grundy County, tells me that she was\\r\\nthe only Norwegian child in school at Lisbon when she first began\\r\\nto attend, but later there gradually came more. At Newark several\\r\\nNorwegians had already begun to move on. Goodman Halvorson (b. 1821)\\r\\nand wife Martha Grindheim from Etne Parish in Söndhordland, came to\\r\\nAmerica in 1847 and purchased land in Fox Township, Kendall County; he\\r\\nerected his log cabin there in the spring of 1848. Halvorson is still\\r\\nliving on the old homestead which, however, he leases to other parties.\\r\\nOsmund Tutland from Hjelmeland in Ryfylke, and wife Malinda from Aardal\\r\\nin Ryfylle and two children had come to Mission Township, La Salle\\r\\nCounty, in 1836; a daughter, Mrs. Anna Hegglund (b. 1842) is at present\\r\\nliving in Newark. Tutland became, in 1854, the founder of the Norwegian\\r\\ncolony at Norway, Benton County, Iowa.[397]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [397] Lars Fruland of Newark is a son of Nils Fröland, who emigrated\\r\\n        from Samnanger, near Bergen, in 1837, settling in La Salle\\r\\n        County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the old pioneers of Lisbon was also Henry Munson from Voss, but\\r\\nI am not able to give the year of his arrival. Munson died in 1907,\\r\\nbeing over ninety years old. Wier Sjurson Weeks (born in Skaanevik in\\r\\n1812), and wife Synneva and two children emigrated in 1846; after much\\r\\nhardship, and sickness in the family, through which they lost the two\\r\\ndaughters, they arrived at Lisbon late in 1846. Here Weeks worked at\\r\\nfirst at the trade of a carpenter. In 1848 he bought eighty acres of\\r\\nland on North Prairie, five miles north of Lisbon.[398] Here he settled\\r\\npermanently, prospered, and became an influential citizen and active\\r\\nmember of the Lutheran Church of North Prairie. Mr. Weeks died in\\r\\nFebruary, 1900, at the age of eighty-seven; his wife lived till 1904,\\r\\nreaching the age of ninety-four. A name most closely associated with\\r\\nthe early annals of Newark is that of Torris Johnson (b. in Skaanevik\\r\\n1837), who came to America with his grandfather Torris Torison in\\r\\n1848.[399] Having arrived at Chicago, they went to Calumet, twenty\\r\\nmiles south of Chicago, to Halstein Torison, who was an uncle of Torris\\r\\nJohnson. There Johnson remained till 1851, when he located in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. Mr. Johnson served in the war, being promoted to sergeant;\\r\\nafter the war he returned to Newark. In 1865 he married Elizabeth\\r\\nRyerson, born in Stavanger, Norway; they have had six children. Mr.\\r\\nJohnson is still living, his home being in Newark.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [398] Mr. Strand has given a very complete sketch of W. S. Weeks to\\r\\n        which I am indebted for these facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [399] His parents died in Norway when he was a child; a brother and\\r\\n        sister also came to America at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough E. S. Holland (b. 1834) of Big Grove Township, did not settle\\r\\nin Kendall County before 1866, he belongs to the earlier pioneers now\\r\\nresident there, having come to this country with his parents in 1846.\\r\\nIn 1854 he settled in York Township, Green County, Wisconsin, where he\\r\\nmarried Johanne Chantland the following year. In 1866 they removed\\r\\nto Kendall County, Illinois.[400] Mr. Holland has been especially\\r\\nactive in the work of the church, and has been trustee and treasurer of\\r\\nPleasant View Luther College since its organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [400] Mrs. Holland died in 1884 and Mr. Holland married Christina\\r\\n        Peterson of Skien, Norway, in 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Nels O. Cassem occupies a prominent place in the history of\\r\\nthe settlement as of that of Kendall County in general. Born in 1829\\r\\nabout seven miles east of the city of Stavanger, Norway, he emigrated\\r\\nin 1849. Coming to Illinois he settled in Fox Township, Kendall County,\\r\\nin July of that year. Here he purchased land and began farming, an\\r\\noccupation which he prospered in to an unusual degree, his estate\\r\\nbeing estimated at a little over one million dollars upon his death in\\r\\n1904.[401] \"When he came to Illinois,\" writes his son, \"he found work\\r\\non the tow-path of the old Illinois and Michigan Canal, at fifty cents\\r\\nper day. During this time he formed the habit of saving, that was the\\r\\nunerring guide of all his future life.\" Randall Cassem defines the\\r\\nprincipal causes of his father\\'s success as:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Health; industrious habits formed in youth; the fact that money\\r\\n  came hard earned at first, thus teaching him the value of the\\r\\n  dollar; courage and self-reliance; knowing the value of little\\r\\n  things; the practice of self-denial and rigid economy; never\\r\\n  striving after extravagant profits in any of his undertakings. To\\r\\n  all of this we may add, his high sense of honor, his unimpeachable\\r\\n  integrity that, as those who knew him testify, never permitted him\\r\\n  to be other than absolutely fair and just in all his dealings and\\r\\n  financial transactions with others.\"[402]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who immigrated in 1844 and located in Chicago was also\\r\\nAnders K. Vetti from Vettigjæld, Norway. He lived in Chicago until\\r\\nabout 1849,[403] when he bought a farm at Yorkville Prairie in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. He married Anna Martha Ortzland in 1850 and lived there till\\r\\nhis death in 1875. Mr. Vetti was a man of strong character and unusual\\r\\nintellectual endowments. He wielded much influence politically in his\\r\\ncommunity, and enjoyed in a high degree the confidence of those who\\r\\nknew him. An obituary notice says of him: his truest and most enduring\\r\\nmonument will be the good resulting from his labor in the cause of\\r\\nuniversal education, in untiring opposition to the superstitious\\r\\nobservance of ceremonies incompatible with the spirit and the progress\\r\\nof the age, and in his hatred of all forms of political oppression.[404]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [401] Cassem married Margaret Fritz in 1851; she died in 1872.\\r\\n        There are five children: Randall Cassem, attorney at Aurora,\\r\\n        Ill.; Mrs. Olive J. Osmondson of Seward Township, Kendall\\r\\n        County; Oscar E. Cassem, Mitchell, South Dakota; Mrs.\\r\\n        Margaret Olson, Aurora, Illinois; and Mrs. Anna O. Rood,\\r\\n        Chicago, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [402] Kari Melhus of Newark, Illinois, who came to America about\\r\\n        1852, is said to be the oldest Norwegian woman in America.\\r\\n        She was born in Hjelmeland Parish, Ryfylke, in 1804.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [403] A. K. Vetti\\'s oldest daughter, Mrs. Samuel Mather (b. 1853)\\r\\n        of Springdale, Linn County, Iowa, says that it was in 1849,\\r\\n        or 1850 perhaps, but she is not certain which.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [404] The words \"universal education\" contain a reference to his\\r\\n        fight for the common schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few miles south of Lisbon, across the Grundy County line, a\\r\\nsettlement was founded in 1846. The county had been completely settled\\r\\nby Americans already, but Norwegians bought these out and gradually\\r\\nsupplanted them, exactly as they began doing a decade later at Saratoga\\r\\nin Grundy County, and have done still later in the city of Morris in\\r\\nthe same county. The settlement is located in Nettle Creek Township.\\r\\nThe first arrivals were Rasmus Scheldal, Ole Torstal, Paul Thompson,\\r\\nMichael Erickson, Simon Frye, John Wing, Lars Scheldal, Ben Hall, Ben\\r\\nThornton, John Peterson, G. E. Grundstad, William and Samuel Hage.\\r\\nSeveral of these men had families; they came mostly from Skaanevik; all\\r\\ncame between 1846 and 1848. In 1849 Halvord Rygh, Sr., and family of\\r\\nseven, and Sjur Nelson, wife, Jennie, and family, came from Norway and\\r\\nlocated there. Several of these men later moved away, as Paul Thompson,\\r\\nMichael Erickson, Rasmus Scheldal, and Ole Tvistal, who went to Story\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, while some members of the Rygh and Wing families went to\\r\\nGoodhue County, Minnesota, 1856. Sjur Haugen and family moved up to\\r\\nHelmar, Kendall County, in 1855.[405]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [405] The latter family included a son Nels (b. 1840), who is Nels\\r\\n        S. Nelson of Helmar, well known as a successful farmer and a\\r\\n        Republican leader in Kendall County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this brief survey of the founding of these eastern extensions of\\r\\nthe Fox River Settlement, we shall leave Kendall and Grundy Counties.\\r\\nThe history of these settlements takes its beginnings at the very close\\r\\nof the period we are here considering. Their fuller discussion belongs\\r\\nto the history of the immigration of the following decade.[406]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [406] Individual settlers and single families had located in\\r\\n        various towns in northern Illinois during the later thirties\\r\\n        and forties. I shall name here Severt S. Helland and wife\\r\\n        Ingeborg who immigrated in 1836 and settled at Woodstock,\\r\\n        Illinois. Helland (b. 1828) came from Gjerdevig in Fjeldbjerg\\r\\n        Parish; his wife was born 1825 at Helland in Etne Parish.\\r\\n        They moved to Chicago in 1855 and in 1857 settled near\\r\\n        Slater, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\n          _The First Norwegian Pioneers in Northeastern Iowa_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this chapter I shall give a brief account of the coming of\\r\\nNorwegians into northeastern Iowa and their founding of settlements\\r\\nthere between 1846 and 1851. We are near the close of the period which\\r\\nthis volume deals with. The founding of settlements in Iowa in 1849-50\\r\\nis but a part of a larger movement now beginning, which, in the course\\r\\nof a few years, resulted in the establishment of numerous settlements\\r\\nin Wisconsin, Iowa, and southeastern Minnesota.[407] These settlements\\r\\nwere founded in general through internal migration away from the older\\r\\nsettlements in Racine, Rock, and Dane Counties. The latter were now\\r\\nbecoming overcrowded and they furnished hundreds upon hundreds of\\r\\nrecruits to the new settlements that were fast springing up. It is with\\r\\nthe years 1848-49 that we associate this new trend in the movement,\\r\\nand which inaugurates this new period in the whole movement. Only its\\r\\nbeginnings will here briefly be sketched as related to the counties of\\r\\nnortheastern Iowa. Of the mass of material which has been placed at my\\r\\ndisposal, I can only select what appears most essential to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [407] And Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first county settled by Norwegians in northeastern Iowa was\\r\\nClayton. The first settlers were Ole H. Valle and wife and Ole T.\\r\\nKittelsland who located in Read Township in the summer of 1846. Both\\r\\nthese men had, however, entered Iowa three years before. In 1843\\r\\nthey had come to the old Fort Atkinson in Winneshiek County, and had\\r\\nremained there for three years in the service of the government.[408]\\r\\nValle and Kittelsland were both from Rollaug, Numedal; they had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1841 to Rock Prairie, and had from 1841-1843 worked in\\r\\nthe Dodgeville mines. In 1846 Sören O. Sörum from Land Parish, Norway,\\r\\ncame to Fort Atkinson and in 1847 Ingeborg Nilsen, a cousin of Ole\\r\\nValle, came there.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [408] Their duties being to show the Indians how to farm and in\\r\\n        general to teach them the white man\\'s ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1846 then, Valle and Kittelsland located in Clayton\\r\\nCounty,[409] buying a farm together, about three miles southeast of\\r\\nthe present village of St. Olaf.[410] Through letters from Valle the\\r\\nlocality was soon brought to the attention of Norwegian settlers in\\r\\nRock Prairie and Koshkonong. In the spring of 1849 Ole Herbrandson\\r\\nand family came out there from Koshkonong; he was an immigrant from\\r\\nMörkvold, Rollaug, in 1842 and had, it seems, visited Valle in Clayton\\r\\nCounty in 1848 and found the locality to his liking. In June[411]\\r\\nHalvor Nilsen Espeseth, Knut Hustad, Ole Sonde, and Ingbret Skarshaug,\\r\\ncame from Rock Prairie;[412] going to the western part of the county,\\r\\nNilsen selected land in Grand Meadow Township, becoming the founder\\r\\nof the Clermont extension of the settlement, which, as Norwegians\\r\\nbegan to come in gradually, expanded north into Fayette and Winneshiek\\r\\nCounties. Other arrivals of the same summer were Abraham Rustad\\r\\nand family, Bredo A. Holt, Jens A. Holt, all from Hadeland, Bertle\\r\\nOsuldson, Tallak Gunderson and family from Arendal, and Ole Hanson and\\r\\nfamily. These located in the Clermont region; Jens Holt on section\\r\\n17, Marion Township, and Hanson on section 6 in the same township.\\r\\nAbout simultaneous with these, Fingar Johnson, Helge Ramstad and wife,\\r\\nThorkel Eiteklep[413] Ole E. Sanden, with wife Guro and family, located\\r\\nin the eastern settlement.[414]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [409] The first white child born of Norwegian parents in the county\\r\\n        was Jorund Valle (Mrs. Lars Thovson, St. Olaf), daughter of\\r\\n        Ole Valle.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [410] See article by Rev. Jacob Tanner, entitled: \"En kort\\r\\n        Beretning 50 Aars kirkelight Arbeide; Clayton County, Iowa,\"\\r\\n        in _Lutheraneren_, 45 (1901). My facts here are gathered in\\r\\n        large part from this article.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [411] The date was June 11th according to _History of Clayton\\r\\n        County_, 1882, p. 831.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [412] The last three were from Hallingdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [413] According to others these two did not arrive till 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [414] Tanner\\'s article. Sanden and Fingar Johnson settled in Wagner\\r\\n        Township.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founders of these settlements nearly all came from Rock Prairie,\\r\\nwhere they had lived the first few years after immigrating. During\\r\\nthe years 1850-1851 a large number of immigrants joined the colony.\\r\\nThe first of these were Lars Valle, Hellik Glaim,[415] and Austen\\r\\nBlækkestad, all from Numedal, Ole Engbrigtsen and Peter Helgeson from\\r\\nSigdal in Numedal, and Ole Gunbjörnson and Knut Jæger from Hallingdal,\\r\\nwhile Halstein Gröth and family from Næs in Hallingdal and Kittil Rue\\r\\nlocated in the western part of the settlement. The Gröth family located\\r\\nin Marion Township, where also James and Jacob Paulson Broby, who came\\r\\nfrom Hadeland the next year, settled. Mrs. Holger Peterson and son\\r\\n(Peter Holgerson) came in 1851 and settled in Wagner Township. Sören O.\\r\\nSörum and wife[416] settled in Farmersburg Township in 1850, being the\\r\\nfirst Norwegians there.[417]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [415] See above page 143.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [416] See note, on p. 213.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [417] In 1867 he moved to Wagner Township.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the very beginning of this period the movement was directed to\\r\\nthe counties to the North, Allamakee and Winneshiek. The immigration\\r\\nof Norwegians into Clayton County had practically ceased by 1855,\\r\\nthe chief reason for this probably being that the Germans came in\\r\\nvery large numbers, particularly to Clayton County, during the early\\r\\nfifties and soon occupied all the best land.[418] Northeastern Iowa\\r\\nwas but little settled, and the development of the wilderness had\\r\\nonly begun. Clayton County had in 1850 a population of three thousand\\r\\neight hundred and seventy-three, while Fayette had only eight hundred\\r\\nand twenty-five, and Allamakee seven hundred and seventy-seven. The\\r\\npopulation of Winneshiek County had reached four thousand nine hundred\\r\\nand fifty-seven.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [418] Rev. Tanner writes: \"When we look at this Norwegian\\r\\n        settlement as it was then and is to-day largely, it\\r\\n        immediately strikes us that it was wood and water the\\r\\n        colonists looked for, and therefore they let the prairie lie\\r\\n        and chose the hills along the Turkey River. Not until later\\r\\n        did they learn to understand the value of the prairie, but\\r\\n        then the Germans had taken most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAllamakee was the next county in order of settlement.[419] This county\\r\\nwas opened to settlement in 1848, but land was not put upon the market\\r\\nbefore 1850.[420] In 1849 Ole L. Rothnem, Ole O. Storlag, Ole K.\\r\\nGrimsgaard and Erik K. Barsgrind came from Rock County to Allamakee\\r\\nCounty and selected land. In 1850 they moved out with their families\\r\\nand in company with them came: Ole K. Stake, Arne K. Stake, Syver Wold\\r\\nand Thomas A. Grönna. Others who came about the same time were: Thomas\\r\\nAnderson[421] and wife Emilie, Sven E. Hesla,[421] Björn Hermundson,\\r\\nNils T. Rue, Östen Peterson, Lars Jeglum, Halvor E. Turkop, Ole S.\\r\\nLekvold, all from Hallingdal, and Nils N. Arnesgaard, who was from\\r\\nNumedal. Among others who followed the next year I shall mention: Knut\\r\\nKnutson,[422] G. H. Fagre and wife Katherine, and Ole Smeby (b. 1804),\\r\\nwife and sons Hans, Ole, and John. They settled on the prairie north\\r\\nof Paint Creek, living in their canvas-covered wagons until houses\\r\\nwere built. Those here named formed the nucleus of the Paint Creek\\r\\nSettlement, which already the next year received large accessions.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [419] The Fayette County settlement about Clermont is a western\\r\\n        extension of the second settlement in Clayton County; its\\r\\n        beginnings have been referred to above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [420] The first entry of purchase appears under the date of October\\r\\n        7, 1850. The earliest settler in the county was Henry\\r\\n        Johnson, after whom Johnsonsport was named, but I do not know\\r\\n        of what nationality he was.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [421] Hesla had came to America in 1845, Anderson in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [422] Settled in Makee Township; he had came from Norway in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early settlers of Allamakee and neighboring counties experienced\\r\\nall the trials and hardships of pioneer life in an unsettled country.\\r\\nThere was no railroad nearer than Milwaukee. At McGregor there were\\r\\na few stores where the necessaries of life could be had.[423] The\\r\\nprocess of home building and the clearing of the forests was slow and\\r\\noften attended with many difficulties. The pioneers generally brought\\r\\nwith them no other wealth than stout hearts and strong hands, and it\\r\\nwas only by industry and severe economy that they were able to make a\\r\\nliving for themselves and their families. Those who hired out to others\\r\\nreceived very small wages, and as there was little money among the\\r\\npioneer farmers this was paid in large part in food or other articles.\\r\\nIt may serve as an illustration that in the winter of 1850-51 a pioneer\\r\\nin Clayton County[424] split seven thousand rails of wood for fifty\\r\\ncents a hundred; for this he was paid $3.50 in cash and the remainder\\r\\nin food.[425]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [423] In the Clermont Settlement there was a log-cabin store at the\\r\\n        village of Clermont.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [424] This pioneer is still living.--See Tanner\\'s article.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [425] A barrel of flour at that time cost twelve dollars in Iowa, and\\r\\n        a bushel of corn seventy five cents. The usual wages was 25c a\\r\\n        day, sometimes a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Norwegians who first settled in Allamakee County came from\\r\\nRock County, Wisconsin; later, some came from Dane County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nand also from Winneshiek County, where a settlement was formed in June,\\r\\n1850. Several, however, came from Norway by way of New Orleans and the\\r\\nMississippi, as did Gilbert C. Lyse in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1856 there were in the whole county five hundred and five\\r\\nNorwegians; one hundred and eighty-one of these had settled in Paint\\r\\nCreek (then Water-ville) Township, the rest being located mostly in\\r\\nthe neighboring towns of Center, La Fayette, Taylor, Jefferson and\\r\\nMakee. In the meantime a new settlement had been established in the\\r\\nnorthwestern part of the county, in Hanover and Waterloo, which soon\\r\\nextended into Winneshiek County. But the earliest Norwegian settlement\\r\\nin Winneshiek was formed on Washington Prairie in June, 1850,[426] when\\r\\na number of families moved in from Racine and Dane Counties, Wisconsin.\\r\\nEastern Winneshiek County received in the following year a large\\r\\nNorwegian population.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [426] The county was organized in 1850, and the first term of court\\r\\n        convened on October 5th, 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who came in the latter part of June, 1850, and settled on\\r\\nWashington Prairie were: Eric Anderson (Rudi),[427] the brothers Ole\\r\\nand Staale T. Haugen from Flekkefjord, Ole G. Jevne, Ole and Andrew\\r\\nA. Lomen, Knut A. Bakken, Anders Hauge, John J. Quale, and Halvor H.\\r\\nGroven, all from Valders, and Mikkel Omli from Telemarken. On July\\r\\nthird another party headed by Nels Johnson[428] arrived, including\\r\\nTollef Simonson Aae, Knud Opdahl, Jacob Abrahamson,[429] Iver P. Quale,\\r\\nGjermund Johnson (Kaasa),[430] and John Thun.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [427] See above page 232.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [428] The father of Martin N. Johnson, member of Congress from\\r\\n        North Dakota. Nelson Johnson was one of the founders of the\\r\\n        Muskego Settlement in Wisconsin in 1839. He later entered\\r\\n        the Methodist ministry and was for two years, 1855-1857,\\r\\n        pastor of the Norwegian M. E. Church in Cambridge, Wisconsin.\\r\\n        With the exception of these two years he lived in Winneshiek\\r\\n        County until his death in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [429] Father of Rev. Abraham Jacobson, to whom I am in part\\r\\n        indebted for facts on the early settlement of Washington\\r\\n        Prairie. Rev. Jacobson has also printed a pamphlet: _The\\r\\n        Pioneer Norwegians_, Decorah, 1905, 16 pages, which is a most\\r\\n        valuable contribution to the pioneer history of Winneshiek\\r\\n        County. A very brief chapter on the \"Pioneer Norwegians\" may\\r\\n        also be found in Alexander\\'s _History of Winneshiek County_,\\r\\n        1882, pages 185-186.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [430] A brother of Nels Johnson. Thun was from Valders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the coming of this party Reverend Jacobson has given the following\\r\\naccount: In the spring of 1850 his parents and a number of other\\r\\nfamilies left Muskego to move out west. The leader of the party\\r\\nwas Nels Johnson; he had a large military wagon drawn by six oxen.\\r\\n\"This had a big box on, filled with household goods and covered with\\r\\nwhite canvas. On the outside was placed, lengthwise, the wagon box,\\r\\nseveral joints of stove pipe, so the outfit, with a little stretch\\r\\nof imagination,\" says Rev. Jacobson, \"looked like a man-of-war; this\\r\\nwas the so-called \\'prairie-schooner.\\' Then there were other vehicles\\r\\nof all sizes and shapes, from truck wagons, the wheels of which were\\r\\nmade of solid sections of oak logs, down to the two-wheel carts.\" At\\r\\nKoshkonong, Dane County, so many more joined them that they were in\\r\\nall over one hundred individuals; the caravan included furthermore\\r\\nnow two hundred head of cattle, a few hogs and sheep, a mare and a\\r\\ncolt. They drove on via Madison, then a little village, to Prairie du\\r\\nChien, where the party divided one-half going to Vernon County,[431]\\r\\nWisconsin, the other half to Iowa. Reverend Jacobson says of the\\r\\njourney at this point:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Wisconsin river had to be crossed on a small ferry boat, the\\r\\n  propelling power was furnished by a horse placed on a tread-power\\r\\n  which worked the paddle-wheels. Only one wagon and a team at a\\r\\n  time could be taken aboard. The herd of loose cattle had to swim\\r\\n  over the river, all of which was accomplished without any accident\\r\\n  worthy of note. The ferry boat at Prairie du Chien was larger\\r\\n  and propelled by four mule power, but the water being high, the\\r\\n  Mississippi River was nearly two miles wide, and much time was\\r\\n  taken to get all to the western bank. Thirteen miles northwest from\\r\\n  McGregor at Poverty Point, since called Monona, another halt of a\\r\\n  creek was made. The scouting party before alluded to had visited\\r\\n  several localities, and opinions were divided as to which was the\\r\\n  best point to settle down. The company was now divided into three\\r\\n  divisions, we going with the original leader to the vicinity of\\r\\n  Decorah, landing on our claims on the third of July. The journey\\r\\n  had taken five weeks, counting from the time of starting. Those who\\r\\n  had room enough slept under the wagon covers, the others slept on\\r\\n  the bare ground under the wagons.[432]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [431] The Norwegian settlement at and about Westby, Vernon Co.,\\r\\n        dates from this time, 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [432] Speaking of the Indians Rev. Jacobson says, \"They had their\\r\\n        homes in the Territory of Minnesota, and did not molest the\\r\\n        settlers in the least.\" On the banks of the Upper Iowa river\\r\\n        many Indian graves were found. The bodies were buried in a\\r\\n        sitting position, with the head sometimes above the ground. A\\r\\n        forked stick put up like a post at each end of the grave held\\r\\n        a ridge pole on which leaned thin boards, placed slanting\\r\\n        to each side of the grave. Thus each grave presented the\\r\\n        appearance of the gable of a small house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf this party Simonson, Opdahl, Abrahamson, and Quale settled in\\r\\nSpringfield, the rest in Decorah and Glenwood Townships.[433] Most of\\r\\nthe members of these parties had come to America several years before,\\r\\nas Opdahl in 1848 and Tostenson in 1847; three of them, as we know,\\r\\nRudi and the two Johnsons, had immigrated in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [433] The eastern two-thirds of Winneshiek County clear to the\\r\\n        Minnesota line in a few years became extensively settled by\\r\\n        Norwegians.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small party from Jefferson Prairie, Wisconsin, including Tore P.\\r\\nSkotland and his brother Endre P. Sandanger, Ellef and Lars Land,\\r\\nnatives of Ringerike, also came the same summer; these secured claims\\r\\naround Calmar. The first list of landed assessments in Winneshiek\\r\\nCounty[434] records the names of Jacob Abrahamson, Knud Guldbrandson\\r\\n(Opdahl), Ole Gullikson (Jevne), Egbert Guldbrandson (Saland), Erik\\r\\nClement (Skaali), Halvor Halvorson (Groven), O. A. Lomen, Ole Larsen\\r\\nBergan, Mikkel Omli, Tollef Simonson (Aae), T. Hulverson, and Ole\\r\\nTostenson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [434] According to Reverend Jacobson, _The Pioneer Norwegian_ p. 5;\\r\\n        the list is for 1852.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other settlers of 1850, not named above, I may name: Nils\\r\\nThronson, who had come from Valders in 1848, settling in Dane County,\\r\\nWisconsin he located in Glenwood Township in the summer of 1850;\\r\\nChristopher A. Estrem from Vang Parish, who had immigrated to Chicago\\r\\nin 1848; he came to Winneshiek County and located in Frankville\\r\\nTownship as one of the very first Norwegians there; Engebret Haugen,\\r\\nwho had immigrated in 1842, locating near Beloit, Wisconsin; the family\\r\\nsettled near Decorah in 1850, purchasing the old Indian Trading Post\\r\\nthen owned by J. G. Rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1850 Johannes Evenson, Ole L. Bergan, Knud L. Bergan,\\r\\nand Jörgen Lommen came. Of these Evenson located west of Decorah, in\\r\\nMadison Township, becoming the first Norwegian to settle there.[435]\\r\\nAs near as I can tell, Lars Iverson Medaas and family were the first\\r\\nNorwegians to settle in Canoe Township. Iverson who was born at\\r\\nTillung, Voss (in 1802), but had married Sigrid Vikingsdatter in\\r\\nGraven, Hardanger (1835) and settled on the farm Medaas, emigrated to\\r\\nAmerica in 1850. They spent the first winter on Liberty Prairie, Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, and moved to Winneshiek County early in the spring\\r\\nof 1851, locating in Canoe Township, on section two, where they lived\\r\\ntill their death.[436]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [435] Helge N. Myrand and his widowed mother, who had immigrated in\\r\\n        1841 and settled in Muskego County, came west and located in\\r\\n        Madison in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [436] Iverson died in 1887, his wife in 1890. Iver Larson, well\\r\\n        known merchant and for many years treasurer of the United\\r\\n        Norwegian Lutheran Church, who died in 1907, was a son of\\r\\n        Iverson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegians to enter Hesper Township were a party of\\r\\nimmigrants who came by the ship _Valhalla_ from Tönsberg in the summer\\r\\nof 1852. They were from Tolgen, in northern Österdalen, and from Röraas\\r\\nand Guldalen,[437] hence from a much more northerly region than their\\r\\ncountrymen in southern Winneshiek County. The party consisted of the\\r\\nfollowing: Trond Laugen, John Losen, Sr., Bendt Pederson, Ingbrigt\\r\\nBergh, Mons Monsen, all of whom were married, and John Vold and Jocum\\r\\nNelson. These were followed in the next year by John S. Losen, Jr., and\\r\\nOle B. Anderson Borren. Among the earliest settlers from other regions\\r\\nwere Paul Thorsen, Salve Olson and Torjus Gunderson from Sætersdalen,\\r\\nKnut Herbrandson and Christian Lien from Hallingdal, Aadne Glaamene and\\r\\nfamily from Voss, Lars Bakka and Bendik Larson from Sogn, and Peder\\r\\nWennes from Vardalen.[438]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [437] They were the first emigrants to America from this district.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [438] For the facts on Hesper Township I am indebted to Mr. J. A.\\r\\n        Nelson of Prosper, Minnesota, a student in the State University\\r\\n        of Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the towns of Springfield, Decorah, and Glenwood, the settlement\\r\\nthus soon spread into the neighboring townships--north into Canoe,\\r\\nHesper, and Highland, where it united with the settlement in\\r\\nnorthwestern Allamakee County, and south through the towns of Calmar\\r\\nand Military, uniting with the settlement in north central Fayette\\r\\nCounty in Door Township. This last settlement extends through Pleasant\\r\\nValley southward into Clayton County. Together these settlements form\\r\\nthe eastern part of Clayton County, west through Fayette, and north\\r\\nthrough Winneshiek to northern Allamakee. In Allamakee it extends as\\r\\nfar as Harper\\'s Ferry and Lansing. The bulk of the population, however,\\r\\nis found in Winneshiek County. The principal Norwegian townships are:\\r\\nGlenwood, Decorah, Springfield, Madison, and Highland. About half of\\r\\nthe population of the county is of Norwegian birth, or of that descent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\n      _Survey of Immigration from Norway to America. Conclusion._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are then at the end of our task. We discussed at first early\\r\\nindividual immigration from Norway down to the year 1825. Then tracing\\r\\nbriefly the fortunes of the party of immigrants who came from Norway\\r\\nthat year we followed the subsequent immigration, year by year,\\r\\ndown to 1848, and the founding of settlements in this country from\\r\\nOrleans County, New York, in 1825, to Winneshiek County, Iowa, in\\r\\n1850. The growth of the emigration movement in Norway and the course\\r\\nof settlements here have been indicated. The names of the promoters\\r\\nof emigration in each district and province and of the founders of\\r\\nsettlements have in all cases been given. In most cases we have\\r\\nsucceeded in giving a fairly complete list of names of the settlers\\r\\nin any community during the first four to eight years of its history,\\r\\nthat is its period of growth, the years during which it assumed the\\r\\ncharacter of a Norwegian settlement. The varied causes of emigration\\r\\nwere also discussed at some length as also other questions as the\\r\\ncost of passage and duration and course of the journey; and in the\\r\\ndiscussion of the individual settlements we have now and then given\\r\\na glimpse of the general conditions of life in early pioneer days.\\r\\nI desire now by way of conclusion to summarize briefly the course of\\r\\nemigration in Norway and the distribution of the representatives of\\r\\neach district in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first emigrants from Norway were from Stavanger, Haugesund and\\r\\nRyfylke. Before 1836 the movement did not reach out beyond these\\r\\ndistricts although a few individuals had come from Söndhordland and\\r\\nHardanger. The emigration from Hardanger begins properly in 1836;\\r\\nthat year also records the first arrivals from Voss.[439] However\\r\\nmost of the immigrants of that year, as the following two years, were\\r\\nfrom the districts that had furnished the emigrants of the decade\\r\\n1825-1835. The year 1837 is especially noteworthy for the sailing of\\r\\nthe first emigrant ship from Bergen and that the immediate vicinity\\r\\nof Bergen for the first time furnished its quota of the emigration.\\r\\nIt is further significant in that Voss now enters definitely into the\\r\\nmovement, and that Upper Telemarken and the neighboring region of West\\r\\nNumedal contributed the first recruits to the American settlements.\\r\\nThe emigrants of 1839 came in considerable part from Upper Telemarken,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, from Voss and Hardanger, but not a few also from the\\r\\nolder districts. This continued in 1840 and 1841, except that there\\r\\nwere no emigrants from Hardanger during these two years and very few\\r\\nfor the next four years also. In 1842 the first party left Sogn and in\\r\\n1844 and 1845 considerable numbers came to America from this district.\\r\\nThe year 1843 is especially noteworthy for the very large emigration\\r\\nof that year from Upper Telemarken and the growth of the movement in\\r\\nnew parishes in Numedal. In this year also the America-fever enters\\r\\nLower Telemarken, a number of families going to America from Holden\\r\\nParish and Kragerö, which in 1844-1845 expands to include Sande and Bö\\r\\nand the region of Skien. During 1843 the first emigrants also leave\\r\\nSætersdalen, and from now on it is to be observed that there is a\\r\\nsteady out-going of emigrants from Ryfylke and Söndhordland for the\\r\\nperiod of nearly a decade. The movement is also beginning to expand\\r\\nin two other directions; north from Numedal into Hallingdal and soon\\r\\nafter northeast from the region of the Sognefjord up to northern and\\r\\nthe extreme Inner Sogn. The influx of immigrants from Telemarken and\\r\\nNumedal continues, and in increased numbers from Voss and the movement\\r\\nbegins anew in Hardanger in 1846. Hallingdal sent forth a large number\\r\\nof families and single persons in 1846-47, most of whom as we know\\r\\nsettled in Rock and La Fayette Counties, Wisconsin, many later moving\\r\\ninto Iowa. In 1847-48 these two movements meet in Valders, the one from\\r\\nHallingdal entering first in South and North Aurdal, the other from\\r\\nLærdal and Aardal in Sogn, entering about 1850 into Vang, Hurum and\\r\\nWest Slidre in Valders. In the meantime the movement has traveled also\\r\\nfrom Lower Telemarken, Drammen and Eastern Numedal (Sigdal) up through\\r\\nRingerike, Hadeland and Land. Especially large was the emigration\\r\\nfrom North and South Land clear to Torpen in 1847-1850. The region\\r\\neast of Land, i. e., Toten, Hedemarken and Solör furnish occasional\\r\\nimmigrants from now on but not in considerable numbers until many years\\r\\nlater. From Land and from Valders the movement grows northward into\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen and northwestward into Österdalen and Trondhjem, from\\r\\nwhich provinces, however, relatively very few emigrated to America\\r\\nuntil after 1850, and the emigration was not heavy from this region or\\r\\nfrom the northern coast districts,--Söndfjord, Nordfjord, Söndmöre,\\r\\nNordmöre--until after the Civil War.[440]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [439] At least eighteen persons from Hardanger and two from Voss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [440] And from Nordland not until after 1875. It is to be observed\\r\\n        also that the emigration from the older inland districts was\\r\\n        very heavy clear down to 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the number of immigrants that each of the districts had\\r\\ncontributed to the American population before 1850, or have down to the\\r\\npresent time, it would be difficult to say. The emigration from such\\r\\nvast districts as Telemarken and Sogn, as later from Gudbrandsdalen,\\r\\nHedemarken and Österdalen, has been heaviest, while from Ryfylke and\\r\\nVoss the incoming settlers have been very numerous, as also from the\\r\\nsmall but very populous Söndhordland, Hadeland and Land. Valdris and\\r\\nHallingdal[441] each about half as large as Sogn have contributed\\r\\nperhaps each about one-third as many immigrants as Sogn, each\\r\\ncontributing about equally to the American emigration. Relatively\\r\\nsmall has been the immigration from Hardanger, Sætersdalen and the\\r\\nvicinity of Stavanger. The extensive districts of Telemarken and Sogn\\r\\nentered early into the movement and have continued down to the present\\r\\ntime to furnish large numbers of recruits to the Norwegian immigrant\\r\\npopulation. Representatives of these two regions, the immigrated and\\r\\ntheir descendants, are, I believe, most numerous among the various\\r\\ngroups of Norwegian settlers in America.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [441] In 1891 Hallingdal had a population of 12,900, Valdris 17,000,\\r\\n        Sogn 37,050, Söndhordland 34,750, Hardanger 25,900, Ryfylke\\r\\n        46,000, Telemarken 44,000, Sætersdalen 8,380. The population\\r\\n        of each is much larger now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this country the relative position of the representatives of each\\r\\nis about that which they occupied in the old; this finds its reason\\r\\nchiefly in the time at which the different states were opened up to\\r\\nsettlers. Natives from Stavanger, Ryfylke and Söndhordland are found\\r\\nchiefly in Illinois and in the settlements of Central Iowa (Benton\\r\\nand Story Counties). In Illinois are located also in large numbers\\r\\nnatives of Hardanger (Lee County), and Voss (Chicago), but only to a\\r\\nvery limited extent those of other districts. In Southern Wisconsin\\r\\nand to a slight extent in the adjacent parts of Illinois have located\\r\\nespecially the natives of Numedal, and to some extent those of Land\\r\\nand Sogn. Natives of Sogn have, however, found homes most extensively\\r\\nin the various settlements of Wisconsin and Minnesota and Northern\\r\\nIowa.[442] Here they are present in all parts of the states but in\\r\\nlargest numbers in the oldest settlements in Southern and Western\\r\\nWisconsin and in Southeastern Minnesota. Natives of Telemarken are\\r\\nfound well scattered, from their original center in Racine County,\\r\\nthrough Walworth and Dane Counties, thence to Central Wisconsin and\\r\\nMinnesota. The representatives of Valders are found in largest numbers\\r\\nin Western Dane County, in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, and in Goodhue\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [442] In Winneshiek and Worth Counties, where also natives of\\r\\n        Hallingdal have settled in large numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will not be possible to discuss here the later development of the\\r\\nvarious settlements that have been treated above or the increase of the\\r\\nNorwegian factor in the counties where these settlements were formed.\\r\\nSpace forbids this, and these facts have, furthermore, been briefly\\r\\nindicated elsewhere in this volume. Thus in Chapter II we have outlined\\r\\nthe extent of immigration from Norway and the geographical distribution\\r\\nof settlements, while the subsequent history of the special settlements\\r\\nhas often been briefly indicated. It may here be added that the\\r\\ncounties in Southern Wisconsin as a whole enjoyed a much more rapid\\r\\ndevelopment during the years 1840-1850 than those of Northern Illinois,\\r\\nand that this was due in a very large measure to the incoming of such\\r\\na large number of settlers from Norway[443] in the best years of their\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [443] Similarly the \"Norwegian\" county of La Salle in Illinois\\r\\n        was the leading county in that part of Illinois in the same\\r\\n        period, its population in 1850 being 17,815, that of Grundy\\r\\n        3,023, and De Kalb, 7,540.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1900 the principal Norwegian counties among those that fall\\r\\nwithin the scope of the discussion in this volume were in order: Cook\\r\\nCounty, Illinois; Dane County, Wisconsin; Winneshiek County, Iowa;\\r\\nMilwaukee County, Wisconsin; Rock County, Wisconsin; and La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has elsewhere in this volume been shown that Wisconsin early became\\r\\nthe objective point of immigrants from Norway. This significant\\r\\nposition in Norwegian-American history Wisconsin continued to hold\\r\\nthroughout the whole period we have discussed and for a long time\\r\\nafterwards. In 1850, fifty per cent of all Norwegians in the United\\r\\nStates were domiciled within the borders of the State of Wisconsin. It\\r\\nwas with Wisconsin that the chief events in early Norwegian-American\\r\\nhistory are associated. The principal scenes in the great pioneer drama\\r\\nwere enacted here. As all the paths of the Norwegian immigrant in that\\r\\nearly day led to Wisconsin so the threads of all subsequent Norwegian\\r\\nhistory in America lead back to Wisconsin.[444] Whether in material\\r\\nwelfare, in church, in politics or in education it was in Wisconsin\\r\\nthat the Norwegian first made a place for himself in America and laid\\r\\nthe foundation for all his later progress.[445]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [444] Barring the relatively very small Norwegian factor in the\\r\\n        cities of the East, which stands practically isolated from\\r\\n        Norwegian American life.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [445] At the same time we must not forget that the era of\\r\\n        settlement began in Illinois, and Illinois has always\\r\\n        continued to hold a prominent place in Norwegian-American\\r\\n        history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               Appendices\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               APPENDIX I\\r\\n\\r\\n

The subject died in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several footnotes which are referred to more than once (47\\r\\nand 85). These may be errors, but are retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 313, the words \"at the homestead near West Koshkonong\" are\\r\\nrepeated and have been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 269, the reference to footnote 277 was misprinted as \"227\", and\\r\\nhas been corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 319, the references to notes 347-349 appear out of order,\\r\\nfollowing, rather than preceding, notes 350 and 351 on p. 318. The\\r\\nnumbering has been retained, though the footnotes, all moved to the end\\r\\nof the Registry covered by these pages, appear in numerical order.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 322, the reference to footnote 356 is missing from the text, but\\r\\nperhaps belongs to the entry for \"Ole (Leirdal)\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe index has a number of editorial issues. Minor inconsistencies of\\r\\npunctuation are corrected without mention here. There are number of\\r\\nentries which lack page references. Some can be found in the text, and\\r\\nare provided in the list below.

Johnson\", for which there\\r\\nis no page number, and no obvious mention in the text under either name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surname \"Sane\" in the index is an error and refers to the name\\r\\n\"Saue\". It has been corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nProper names are sometimes inconsistent, especially between the text\\r\\nand footnotes. The ae ligature is variously spelled \\'ae\\' or \\'ei\\'.\\r\\nUnless there are many instances of a given spelling, both are retained\\r\\n(e.g., \"Spelleman\" vs. \"Spellemand\"). The letter ö sometimes is printed\\r\\nwithout the diaeresis as \\'o\\'. Where the preponderance of instances\\r\\nof a given name are correct, the offender has been corrected. In the\\r\\nRegistry in Chapter XXXVII, the surnames for Peder Amund Egdetvedt and\\r\\nColbein Torkildsen Edgetvedt differ.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'",

It is possible that I may at\\r\\nsome future time return to these studies to trace the further growth of\\r\\nthe Scandinavian element and its place and influence in American life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour years ago I contributed an article to _The Iowa Journal of\\r\\nHistory and Politics_ upon \"The Scandinavian Factor in the American\\r\\nPopulation,\" in which I discussed briefly the causes of emigration\\r\\nfrom the Northern countries. This article forms the basis of chapters\\r\\nVI-VIII of the present volume, much new evidence from later years\\r\\nhaving, however, been added. In a subsequent issue of the same Journal\\r\\nI published an article on \"The Coming of the Norwegians to Iowa,\" which\\r\\nis embodied in part in chapters III-V of this volume. The remaining\\r\\nthirty-six chapters are new. During the last three summers I have\\r\\ncontinued my investigation of that part of the subject which deals with\\r\\nthe immigration movement. This book represents the results of that\\r\\ninvestigation down to 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor invaluable assistance in the investigation I gratefully acknowledge\\r\\nindebtedness to the numerous pioneers whom, from time to time, I have\\r\\ninterviewed and who so kindly have given the aid sought. I wish to\\r\\nthank, also, several persons who generously have accepted the task of\\r\\npersonally gathering pioneer data for certain localities. For such help\\r\\nI owe a debt of gratitude to the following persons: J. W. Johnson,\\r\\nRacine, Wisconsin; Reverend A. Jacobson, Decorah, Iowa; Reverend G. A.\\r\\nLarsen, Clinton, Wisconsin; Henry Natesta, Clinton, Wisconsin; Rev. O.\\r\\nJ. Kvale, Orfordville, Wisconsin; Rev. J. Nordby, Lee, Illinois; Dr. N.\\r\\nC. Evans, Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin; M. J. Engebretson, Gratiot, Wisconsin;\\r\\nDan K. Anderson and wife, Woodford, Wisconsin; Ole Jacobson, Elk Horn,\\r\\nWisconsin; Samuel Sampson, Rio, Wisconsin; T. M. Newton, Grinnell,\\r\\nIowa; Harvey Arveson, Whitewater, Wisconsin; and Reverend Helge\\r\\nHöverstad, Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin. My thanks are also due to Reverend\\r\\nG. G. Krostu of Koshkonong Parsonage for having placed at my disposal\\r\\nthe Koshkonong Church Register from 1844-1850; as also for verifying\\r\\nmy copy of it in some cases of names and dates; for the privilege\\r\\naccorded me of using these so precious documents I am most grateful.\\r\\nReverend K. A. Kasberg of Spring Grove, Minnesota, has given me certain\\r\\nimportant data on part of the immigration to East Koshkonong in 1842,\\r\\nand similarly N. A. Lie of Deerfield, Wisconsin, for immigration from\\r\\nVoss in 1838-1844, and Mr. Elim Ellingson and wife of Capron, Illinois,\\r\\non the founders of the Long Prairie Settlement. Many others might be\\r\\nmentioned who have given valuable assistance by letter and otherwise\\r\\nin the course of the investigation, and to whom I owe much. Finally,\\r\\nI wish to thank Dr. N. C. Evans of Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin, for the loan\\r\\nof _Cyclopedia of Wisconsin_ (1906) and _Illustreret Kirkehistorie_\\r\\n(Chicago, 1898); Mr. O. N. Falk of Stoughton, Wisconsin, for loaning\\r\\nme _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869-1870, and my brother, Martin O. Flom, of\\r\\nStoughton, for securing for my use several Wisconsin Atlases and a copy\\r\\nof _The Biographical Review of Dane County_ (1893).\\r\\n\\r\\nOf published works on Norwegian immigration which I have found\\r\\nespecially useful are to be mentioned S. Nilsen\\'s _Billed-Magazin_ on\\r\\ncauses of immigration and the earliest immigrants from Telemarken and\\r\\nNumedal; R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter on Norwegian Immigration_\\r\\nfor the sloopers of 1825, and their descendants; Strand\\'s _History\\r\\nof the Norwegians in Illinois_ (1905) for the Norwegians in Chicago;\\r\\nH. L. Skavlem\\'s sketch of _Scandinavians in the Early Days of Rock\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin_, _Normandsforbundet_ for February, 1909, and several\\r\\narticles in _Symra_, 1905-1908. I must also mention a most valuable\\r\\nseries of articles on the Rock Prairie Settlement, Rock County,\\r\\nWisconsin, which appeared in _Amerika_ in 1906. (See further the\\r\\nBibliography at the end of this volume.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one who has never been engaged in a similar undertaking can have any\\r\\nconception of the difficulty of the task and the labor involved in the\\r\\ncollecting, weighing and sifting of the vast amount of detail material.\\r\\nI have tried to write a work which shall be correct as to details and\\r\\nhistorically reliable. That errors have crept in I doubt not. I shall\\r\\nbe grateful to the reader who may discover such errors if he will call\\r\\nmy attention to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I wish to say that I have attempted nothing complete with\\r\\nreference to the personal sketches of the earliest pioneers; this\\r\\nwas manifestly impossible. I have thought also that this was not\\r\\nhere called for except in cases of founders of settlements, and even\\r\\nhere I have sometimes lacked the full facts. To many it will also\\r\\nundoubtedly seem that the early days of the church and the founding of\\r\\ncongregations should have received more attention. I can only say that\\r\\nthis volume deals specifically with the causes, course and progress of\\r\\nNorwegian immigration and that this plan precluded a discussion in this\\r\\nvolume of religious and educational movements among the pioneers, or\\r\\nof social questions, occupations, public service, and like topics. The\\r\\nwork thus aims to keep only what the title promises, and I hope it will\\r\\nbe found to be a real contribution to history within the scope marked\\r\\nout for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  INTRODUCTION                                                        15\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHAPTER I.

Thereupon will follow\\r\\na brief survey of the course of the movement and the growth of the\\r\\nsettlements founded here in that period. In the introductory pages\\r\\nI shall discuss briefly individual immigration from Norway from its\\r\\nearliest known beginnings down to 1825.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration from Norway resulted in the founding of settlements in\\r\\nNew York, Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa successively; I shall try to\\r\\ngive a correct narrative of the beginnings and the growth of these\\r\\nsettlements. In this part of the work I shall stress the oldest and\\r\\nlargest settlements in Southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois, for\\r\\nthe relation of these to the whole movement and later colonization\\r\\nof the Northwestern States by the Norwegians is one of especial\\r\\nimportance. I shall treat somewhat fully of the causes of emigration,\\r\\nof the growth of the movement, and the part in it that each district\\r\\nor province in Norway has played. The leaders from each district\\r\\nand the founders of the settlements here will be named and in many\\r\\ncases, sketches will be given of their lives. Such questions as the\\r\\ncourse of the movement in Norway, the cost of the voyage, the course\\r\\nof the journey, early wage conditions, the economic conditions of\\r\\nthe immigrants, the geographical trend of settlement, will also be\\r\\nconsidered, and approximately complete lists of the accessions in each\\r\\nsettlement for the first few years will be given. The limits of this\\r\\nvolume, however, will preclude the treatment of social or cultural\\r\\nquestions, or to take more than the briefest notice of the pursuits and\\r\\noccupations of the Norwegian-American and his contribution to American\\r\\nlife. I hope to be able to treat elsewhere, later, of some of these\\r\\nproblems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the immigrant settler is one that is well worth the\\r\\ntelling; it is one that is justly receiving increased attention in\\r\\nrecent years. I believe that the writer of American history will, in\\r\\nthe future, pay far greater attention than he has in the past to the\\r\\nimmigrant pioneer as a factor in the development of the nation. There\\r\\nare in America today about one million people of Norwegian birth, or\\r\\nNorwegian parentage. That is, there are nearly half as many of that\\r\\nnationality in America as in Norway itself. The transplanting of so\\r\\nlarge a proportion of a race from the land to which it is rooted by\\r\\nbirth and by its history is indeed remarkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious European peoples have contributed to the growth of the\\r\\nAmerican population; they have each given something to the sum total\\r\\nof present American life and in some measure helped to shape American\\r\\ninstitutions. As a people America is yet in the formative period;\\r\\nracially, at least, one-half of the population is not Anglo-Saxon.\\r\\nIt is by the amalgamation of all its ethnic factors that the future\\r\\nAmerican people will be evolved. The contribution that each foreign\\r\\nelement will make to that evolution will be determined by the\\r\\ncivilization, which each represents as its racial heritage, the culture\\r\\nwhich, in the course of its history, each has evolved as a people\\r\\nand a nation. As the true student of American history takes note of\\r\\nthese things in the future, the significance of the foreign factor in\\r\\nthe growth and the upbuilding of the country will receive its just\\r\\nrecognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe of Norse blood, but American birth, if we are true to the best\\r\\nthat is in us, cannot fail to have an interest in the trials and\\r\\nthe achievements of the pioneer fathers. We must recognize the true\\r\\nheroism of the men and women who braved the hardships and suffered\\r\\nthe privations of frontier life in the thirties, the forties and\\r\\nthe fifties. The part that the pioneers of those days played in the\\r\\ndevelopment of the Northwest was a great one; in comparison with it\\r\\nthat of the present generation is wholly insignificant. It is to the\\r\\nmemory of those pioneers, in recognition of their true worth, that this\\r\\nrecord of their coming is dedicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Norway: Population, Resources, Pursuits of her\\r\\n         People, Social Conditions, Laws and Institutions._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is, as we know, a long and narrow strip of country in the west\\r\\nof the Scandinavian Peninsula, stretching through thirteen degrees of\\r\\nlatitude, and in the north, extending almost three hundred miles into\\r\\nthe arctic zone. Nearly a third of the entire country[1] is the domain\\r\\nof the midnight sun, where summer is the season of daylight and winter\\r\\nis one long unbroken night. Even in Southern Norway total darkness is\\r\\nunknown in summer, the night being merely a period of twilight. In\\r\\nChristiania the nights are light from April twentieth to the third\\r\\nweek in August, in Trondhjem, a week more at either end. In the latter\\r\\ncity there is broad daylight at midnight from May twenty-third to July\\r\\ntwentieth. Correspondingly there is a period of continuous darkness\\r\\nin the extreme north. Thus at Tromsö the sun is not visible between\\r\\nthe twenty-sixth of November and the sixteenth day of January. The\\r\\nlong night is therefore short as compared with the long day of summer.\\r\\nClimatically, also, Norway is naturally a land of extremes, extending,\\r\\nas it does, over such a vast area north and south. Yet the populous\\r\\nportion of the country, the southern two-thirds, is not appreciably\\r\\ncolder than the State of Iowa and the southern half of Wisconsin\\r\\nand Minnesota. The winter is severest in the great inland valleys.\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen, Valders and Hallingdal, but especially in Österdalen.\\r\\nIn the last-named valley the lowest temperature ever observed has been\\r\\nrecorded, namely, 50°, mercury often having been frozen.[2] The winter\\r\\nis also excessively long in these valleys; in Fjeldberg and Jerkin in\\r\\nthe Dovre Mountains the temperature is below the freezing point two\\r\\nhundred days in the year. In the south and in the west coast-districts\\r\\nthe climate is more uniform and more temperate. Northern Norway, with\\r\\nits gulf stream coast, presents the same general climatic conditions\\r\\nas Western and Southern Norway; the inland region of extreme cold is\\r\\nlimited because of the very limited inland area, which also is very\\r\\nsparsely populated.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1] Or over thirty-eight thousand square miles.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [2] Compare Björnson\\'s account of the temperature at Kvikne in his\\r\\n      autobiographical sketch, _Blakken_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [3] The statistical and much of the other matter in this chapter\\r\\n      has been taken from _Norway, Official Publication for the\\r\\n      Paris Exhibition_, 1900, published at Christiania. But I am\\r\\n      also indebted to the stately publication by Norwegian authors\\r\\n      and artists entitled _Norge i det nittende Aarhundrede_, 2\\r\\n      volumes, large folio, 436 and 468 pages.

The editor in chief for the texts is\\r\\n      Nordahl Rolfsen, for the illustrations E. Werenskjold. There\\r\\n      is a large staff of collaborators, each article is prepared by\\r\\n      a specialist; the whole is a rare piece of book-making. The\\r\\n      printers are Alb. Cammermeyers Forlag, Christiania. I wish\\r\\n      to mention also especially here Christensen\\'s _Det nittende\\r\\n      Aarhundredes Kulturkamp i Norge_, Christiania, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of Norway[4] is very unevenly distributed, the north\\r\\nbeing rather thinly settled. The area of Norway is 124,495 square\\r\\nmiles, or somewhat more than that of Wisconsin and Illinois together.\\r\\nAbout four per cent of this, however, is covered by lakes, and the\\r\\naverage number of inhabitants to the square mile is only seventeen. The\\r\\ncorresponding figures of inhabitants to the square mile for Sweden is\\r\\ntwenty-eight; for Denmark, however, it is one hundred and forty-eight,\\r\\nand for all Europe, it is ninety-eight. The density of population is\\r\\ngreatest in Larvik and Jarlsberg on the south (barring the cities of\\r\\nChristiania and Bergen). In these provinces there are one hundred and\\r\\nsixteen inhabitants to the square mile. In Hedemarken the number falls\\r\\nto twelve. The western fjord districts, those of Trondhjem Fjord, the\\r\\nSogne Fjord and the Hardanger Fjord are thickly populated.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [4] It was 1,490,950 in 1855, 2,350,000 in 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is a land of fjords and lakes, of mountains and glacier\\r\\nexpanses. Less than one-fourth of the country is capable of\\r\\ncultivation, and eighty per cent of this is forest land. This leaves\\r\\nless than five per cent under actual cultivation. We may compare again\\r\\nwith Denmark, where seventy-six per cent of the land is cultivated,\\r\\nwhile in all Europe the ratio is forty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway\\'s climate is noted for its healthfulness,[5] and its inhabitants\\r\\nattain a higher degree of longevity than those of most other European\\r\\ncountries. Nearly seven per cent of its people reach the age of sixty\\r\\nto seventy, while one per cent attain to the age of from ninety to one\\r\\nhundred years. That is, reckoned as a whole, about twelve per cent\\r\\nattain to the age of sixty years or more. This is considerable in excess\\r\\nof that of nearly all other European countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [5] Dr. A. Magelson of Christiania has recently written a work on\\r\\n      Norway as a health resort entitled: _To Norway for Health. A\\r\\n      Scientific Account of the Peculiar Advantages of the Norwegian\\r\\n      Climate_, published by Nikolai Olson, Christiania.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average age in Norway is fifty, while for instance, in Italy it\\r\\nis thirty-five. But the expectancy is far more than this for him who\\r\\npasses infancy; thus if one attains to the age of fifty in Norway, one\\r\\nstill may expect to live twenty-three years. Such is the health and the\\r\\nexpectancy of life among our immigrants from Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predominant pursuit in Norway is agriculture, cattle farming and\\r\\nforest cultivation. Herein forty-eight per cent of the population seeks\\r\\nits maintenance. The immigrant pioneer generally selects in America\\r\\nthe pursuit or occupation for which he has been trained in his native\\r\\ncountry. And so we find that the great majority of Norwegian immigrants\\r\\nhave sought homes in rural communities and engaged in farming and\\r\\nrelated pursuits. In fact, more than eighty-eight per cent of our\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants have come from rural communities. Twenty-three\\r\\nper cent of the population of Norway are engaged in industries and\\r\\nmining. To these occupations in this country, Norway has, especially\\r\\nin the later period of immigration, contributed a considerable share.\\r\\nA little over eight per cent of her people are engaged in fishing.\\r\\nAnd so we find that a proportionately very large amount of the New\\r\\nEngland fisheries is conducted by fishermen who have come from Norway.\\r\\nNavigation engages six per cent of the population of Norway. In this\\r\\nconnection I note that our warships in the Spanish-American war were\\r\\nmany of them manned almost exclusively by Norwegian sailors;[6] and\\r\\nthere were Norwegians in the American marine service as early as the\\r\\nWar of Independence, as again in no small proportion in the Civil War\\r\\nin the sixties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [6] _The Reliance_ which defended the America cup against _Shamrock\\r\\n      III_ in 1903 was manned almost exclusively by Norwegians. They\\r\\n      were from the following towns in Norway: Arendal, Aalesund,\\r\\n      Stavanger, Bergen, Larvik, Christiania, and Haugesund.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps about five per cent of Norway\\'s population is engaged in\\r\\nintellectual work. Here, too, the contribution of Norway to our\\r\\npopulation in America has been considerable, especially during the last\\r\\ntwenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all of the Norwegian population is of the Protestant faith, and\\r\\nthe great majority of these are members of the state church, which is\\r\\nthe Lutheran. Somewhat similar are the affiliations in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitution of Norway is liberal and the government highly\\r\\ndemocratic. In these respects the people of Norway are now perhaps as\\r\\nfavorably circumstanced as we in America. The Norwegian readily enters\\r\\ninto the spirit of American laws and institutions, for their laws are\\r\\nnot essentially different from his own. Being accustomed to a high\\r\\ndegree of freedom, he has been trained to a high conception of the\\r\\nresponsibilities that that freedom entails. He has long been accustomed\\r\\nto representation and sharing in the rights of franchise, and he\\r\\nexercises that right as a privilege and a solemn duty. It may be said,\\r\\nI believe, that no people has a higher sense of right and wrong and a\\r\\nstronger moral incentive to right. Frauds in elections and graft in\\r\\nofficial life are yet unheard-of among our Norwegian-American citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway is, next to Finland, the most temperate of European countries.\\r\\nThe sale of liquor is permitted only in incorporated cities and\\r\\ntowns, and only by an association that is organized under government\\r\\nsupervision. It is the so-called Gothenburg system that is in use. Of\\r\\nthe earnings of such organization the government takes five per cent,\\r\\nthe county ten per cent and the municipality fifteen per cent, while\\r\\nthe net profit of the association must not exceed five per cent on the\\r\\ninvestment in any one year. The hours of sale are very much restricted.\\r\\nNot only is there no sale of liquor on Sundays, but places of such\\r\\nbusiness must close at one o\\'clock on Saturday and on days preceding\\r\\nholidays. Norway is essentially a temperate country. Statistics show\\r\\nthat out of every thousand deaths, only one is due to drink. The\\r\\nNorwegian people have educated themselves to abstinence, and the\\r\\ntemperance movement found wide support earlier in Norway than anywhere\\r\\nelse. _Det norske Totalafholds Selskab_[7] was organized in 1859; ten\\r\\nyears ago it had ten hundred and twenty branches and a hundred and\\r\\nthirty thousand members, while other temperance associations also have\\r\\na considerable membership. Here in America, the Norwegian immigrant has\\r\\ntaken a prominent part in legislation looking toward the restriction of\\r\\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors,[8] and the Prohibition party finds\\r\\nits strongest support among the Norwegians, as it finds a relatively\\r\\nlarge number of its candidates for state and county offices from among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [7] The Norwegian Total Abstinence Society.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [8] When the Sunday closing order was instituted in Minneapolis\\r\\n      in December, 1905, the _Minneapolis Journal_ commented upon\\r\\n      the fact that the Norwegian citizens made no complaint, as it\\r\\n      appears others did.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime conditions in Norway are similarly significant. Comparative\\r\\nstatistics are difficult of access, but Norway\\'s proportion of\\r\\nserious offences is very low. In the whole period from 1891-1895\\r\\nthe total number was only two hundred and sixty-one. Norway has its\\r\\npoor as every country has, but it has its excellent system of taking\\r\\ncare of the poor. Thus every municipality has a Board of Guardians\\r\\n(fattigkommission), which consists of the parish minister, a police\\r\\nofficer, and several men chosen by a local board. Norway keeps her\\r\\ncriminals and takes care of her poor; she does not send them to\\r\\nAmerica, as has only too often been the case in some other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway has a highly developed school system crowned by the Royal\\r\\nFrederik University at Christiania. It has compulsory education, its\\r\\nboards of inspection and its great Department of Public Instruction. It\\r\\nhas its People\\'s High School, its Workingmen\\'s Colleges, and a system\\r\\nof secondary schools, whose curricula are still on a conservative\\r\\nbasis. Its one University ranks with the foremost in Europe, and with\\r\\nit are connected various laboratories and scientific institutions, and\\r\\nit has a library of three hundred and fifty thousand volumes. Here\\r\\ntoo are located its Botanical Gardens, the Historical Museum, the\\r\\nAstronomical and Magnetic Observatory, the Meteriological Institute\\r\\nand the Biological Marine Station.[9] The salaries of its teachers\\r\\nin _Middelskole Gymnasium_, and of instructors and professors in the\\r\\nUniversity, reckoned by the purchasing power of money, is approximately\\r\\nthirty per cent greater than that of our middle western universities.\\r\\nI shall also mention _The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society_ at\\r\\nTrondhjem, founded 1760, a similar society in Christiania, founded\\r\\n1857, the _Bergen Museum_, founded 1825, with its literary and\\r\\nscientific collections illustrative of the life and cultural history of\\r\\nWestern Norway, _The Norwegian National Museum_ in Christiania, founded\\r\\n1894, similar, but more general in character, _The Industrial Arts\\r\\nMuseum_,[10] and the various archives of the Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [9] This is located at Dröbak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [10] Though Norway\\'s participation in the Universal Exposition at\\r\\n       St. Louis in 1904 as regards number of exhibits was limited,\\r\\n       its exhibits were acknowledged to be of very high grade,\\r\\n       thus in its tapestries, in carved and inlaid work, in silver\\r\\n       and enamel displays it received the highest awards. Report\\r\\n       by Consul Fr. Waage, General Commissioner to the St. Louis\\r\\n       Exposition, _Skandinaven_, June 14th, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the Norwegian language I shall merely speak of its highly\\r\\nanalytic character, in which respect it has for a long time been\\r\\ndeveloping in the same direction as English, though of course,\\r\\nabsolutely independently. Being closely cognate with English, a large\\r\\npart of the vocabulary of the two is of the same stock. Further, its\\r\\nsound system is fundamentally similar. These three considerations,\\r\\nespecially perhaps the first, will make clear to us the reason why\\r\\nthe Norwegian so readily learns to use the English language, and\\r\\nif he learns it in youth, even to the point of mastery. This is of\\r\\nthe greatest importance, for language is in modern times the real\\r\\nbadge of nationality. A correct use of the English language is the\\r\\nfirst and chief stamp of American nationality, the key without which\\r\\nthe foreigner cannot enter into the spirit of American life and\\r\\ninstitutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian literature I cannot either discuss here. The great movements\\r\\nit represents in recent times are fairly well known; its significance\\r\\nand its broad influence are beginning to be understood. The genius of\\r\\nNorwegian literature is morality and truth. It expresses herein the\\r\\nhigh ethical sense of the nation, which is pagan-racial, but which is\\r\\nalso Christian-Lutheran, a church which in its preëminent spirituality\\r\\nis the typical Teutonic church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n                     _Emigration from Norway._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmigration from Norway has in large part been transatlantic. Norway\\r\\nhas lost by American emigration a comparatively larger portion of\\r\\nher population than any other country in Europe, with the exception\\r\\nof Ireland. The great majority of the emigrants have gone to the\\r\\nnorthwestern states and found there their future homes. In Northern\\r\\nIllinois, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, in Northern and Western Iowa,\\r\\nin North and South Dakota, they form a very large proportion of the\\r\\npopulation. Emigration to European countries has been directed chiefly\\r\\nto Sweden and Denmark, though not few have settled in England and\\r\\nGermany and some in Holland. Between 1871 and 1875 about fifteen\\r\\nhundred persons emigrated from Norway to Australia; the number that\\r\\nhave gone there since that has been much smaller. These have settled\\r\\nchiefly in South Australia, Victoria and New Zealand. In recent\\r\\nyears some have settled in the Argentine Republic in South America.\\r\\nNorwegians are found in considerable numbers in Western Canada, but the\\r\\nmajority of these have emigrated from the Norwegian communities in the\\r\\nwestern states, especially Minnesota and North Dakota.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian emigration to the United States took systematic form with\\r\\nthe sailing of Norden and _Den Norske Klippe_ in 1836. In 1843 it began\\r\\nto assume larger proportions; in that year sixteen hundred immigrants\\r\\nfrom Norway settled in the United States. During 1866-1870, a period\\r\\nof financial depression in Norway, there left, on an average, about\\r\\nfifteen thousand a year. The rate fell in the seventies, rose again\\r\\nin the eighties, the figure for 1882 being 29,101 persons, while it\\r\\naveraged over eighteen thousand per annum also for the next decade.\\r\\nIn 1898 it was not quite five thousand, then again it rose steadily,\\r\\nreaching 24,461 in 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegian emigration has been mostly from rural districts,\\r\\nday-laborers, artisans, farmers, seamen, but also those representing\\r\\nother pursuits. Not a few with professional or technical education have\\r\\nsettled in America; we find them in the medical profession,[11] in the\\r\\nministry,[12] in journalism, in the faculties of our colleges. All the\\r\\nage-classes are represented among immigrants from Norway, but by far\\r\\nthe largest number of both men and women have come during the ages of\\r\\ntwenty to thirty-five, and particularly the first half of these series\\r\\nof years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [11] Mostly in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [12] In the early period chiefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great emigration of the Norwegian race during the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury has, of course, very materially retarded the growth of the\\r\\npopulation in Norway, especially in the period from 1865 to 1890. The\\r\\nincrease between 1815 and 1835 was as high as 1.34 per cent annually.\\r\\nFrom 1835 to 1865 it was 1.18 per cent, but during 1865-1890 it fell\\r\\nto 0.65 per cent. Since 1890 the increase has been considerable again.\\r\\nBut during 1866-1903 the total emigration from Norway to the United\\r\\nStates alone aggregated five hundred and twenty-four thousand. To this\\r\\nnumber should be added the children of these if we are to have a proper\\r\\nbasis of estimation for the increase of the race in the last half\\r\\ncentury. This increase thus has been 1.40 per cent annually, that is,\\r\\nthe race has doubled itself in fifty years. We may compare with France,\\r\\nwhere the increase has been 0.23 per cent, Russia,[13] where it has\\r\\nbeen 1.35, in Servia, where it has been 2.00 per cent, this being the\\r\\nhighest in Europe. The increase in Sweden and Denmark is about the same\\r\\nas in Norway--reckoning the racial increase.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [13] The figures here are for the period closing with 1890 before\\r\\n       which year Russia had furnished very few emigrants to the\\r\\n       United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be of interest here to consider briefly the immigration from\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the years 1820-1830 not more than 283 emigrated from the\\r\\nScandinavian countries to the United States. In the following decade\\r\\nthe number only slightly exceeded two thousand. Since 1850 our\\r\\nstatistics regarding the foreign born population are more complete. In\\r\\nthat year we find there were a little over eighteen thousand persons\\r\\nin the country of Scandinavian birth. In 1880 this number had reached\\r\\n440,262; while the unprecedented exodus of 1882 and the following\\r\\nyears had by 1890 brought the number up to 933,249. Thus the immigrant\\r\\npopulation from these countries, which in 1850 was less than one per\\r\\ncent, had in 1890 reached ten per cent of the whole foreign element.\\r\\nThe following table will show the proportion contributed by the\\r\\ncountries designated for each decade since 1850:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                TABLE I\\r\\n\\r\\n                     _1850_ _1860_ _1870_ _1880_ _1890_ _1900_\\r\\n                     -------------PER CENT-------------\\r\\n  Ireland            42.8  38.9  33.3  27.8  20.2  15.6\\r\\n  Germany            26    30.8  30.4  29.4  30.1  25.8\\r\\n  England            12.4  10.5  10     9.9   9.8   8.1\\r\\n  Canada              6.6   6     8.9  10.7  10.6  11.4\\r\\n  Scotland and Wales  4.4   3.7   3.8   3.8   3.7   3.2\\r\\n  Scandinavia          .9   1.7   4.3   6.6  10.1  10.3\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it will be seen that among European countries Scandinavia,\\r\\nconsidered as one, stands third in the number of persons contributed\\r\\nto the American foreign-born population, exceeding that of Scotland\\r\\nand Wales in 1870 and that of England in 1890. Both the Irish and\\r\\nthe German immigration reached considerable numbers at least fifteen\\r\\nyears before that from the North, Ireland having contributed nearly\\r\\nforty-three per cent of the total in 1850, and Germany twenty-six. By\\r\\n1900 the Irish quota had fallen to fifteen per cent, while the German\\r\\nis nearly twenty-six and that from Scandinavia ten per cent. In 1870\\r\\nour Scandinavian-born immigrant population was twice as large as the\\r\\nFrench and equalled the total from Holland, Switzerland, Austria,\\r\\nBohemia, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Russia.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [14] The four last named countries have, as we know, in the last\\r\\n       decade entered very extensively into the emigration movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegians are the pioneers in the emigration movement from the\\r\\nNorth in the nineteenth century; the Danes were the last to come in\\r\\nconsiderable numbers. Statistics, however, show that one hundred\\r\\neighty-nine Danes had emigrated to this country before 1830, while\\r\\nthere were only ninety-four from Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian\\r\\nforeign-born population had in 1850 reached 12,678; while that from\\r\\nSweden was 3,559; and Denmark had furnished a little over eighteen\\r\\nhundred. The Danish immigration was not over five thousand a year until\\r\\n1880 and has never reached twelve thousand. The Swedish immigration\\r\\nreceived a new impulse in 1852; it was five thousand in 1868; it\\r\\nreached its climax of 64,607 in 1882. According to Norwegian statistics\\r\\nthe emigration from Norway to the United States was six thousand and\\r\\nfifty in 1853, but according to our census reports did not reach five\\r\\nthousand before 1866; the highest figure, 29,101, was reached in 1882\\r\\n(according to our census).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [15] Or 28,000 according to Norwegian statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total emigration from the Scandinavian countries to America between\\r\\n1820 and 1903 was 1,617,111. This remarkable figure becomes doubly\\r\\nremarkable when we stop to consider that the population of Denmark,\\r\\nNorway, and Sweden is only two and one-half per cent of the total\\r\\npopulation of Europe; yet they have contributed nearly ten per cent of\\r\\nour immigrant population. There are in this country nearly one-third\\r\\nas many Scandinavians (counting those of foreign birth and foreign\\r\\nparentage both) as in the Scandinavian countries; for the German\\r\\nelement the ratio is one to thirteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point I may refer the reader to the table in Appendix I of\\r\\nthis volume, showing the growth and distribution of the Scandinavian\\r\\nfactor, especially in the northwestern states, since 1850. Table I\\r\\nshows Wisconsin as having almost as large a Scandinavian population\\r\\nin 1850 as all the rest of the country. Wisconsin was the destination\\r\\nof the Norwegian immigrant from the time emigration began to assume\\r\\nlarger proportions, and it held the lead for twenty-five years. Iowa\\r\\nand Southern Minnesota began entering into competition prominently\\r\\nsince 1852 and 1855 respectively. The growth of Swedish immigration in\\r\\nthe fifties and sixties gave the lead to Minnesota by 1870, Illinois\\r\\ntaking second place in 1890. Returning now to the Norwegian immigration\\r\\nspecifically, it may be observed that it was directed to the Northwest\\r\\ndown to recent years, almost to the exclusion of the rest of the\\r\\ncountry. The reader may now be referred to Table II in the Appendix,\\r\\nwhich shows the growth of the Norwegian population in each state since\\r\\n1850.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table tells its own story. In New England the Norwegian factor is\\r\\nunimportant. There has been a high ratio of growth in New York and\\r\\nNew Jersey since 1880, but the total number is not large. In the rest\\r\\nof the Atlantic seaboard states, as in the gulf states, the Norwegian\\r\\npopulation has remained almost stationary at a very low figure. Such is\\r\\nalso the case with the inland states of the South, as in the Southwest.\\r\\nThe effort to direct Norwegian immigration to Texas, which goes back to\\r\\nthe forties, has been productive of only meagre results. Even Kansas\\r\\nis too far south for the Norwegian. In the extreme West, however,\\r\\nconsiderable numbers of Norwegians have established homes since about\\r\\n1882, particularly in California, Oregon and Washington, since 1895\\r\\nalso in Montana, and in recent years even in the extreme North, in\\r\\nAlaska.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat were the influences that directed the Norwegian immigrants so\\r\\nlargely to the Northwest in the early period and down to 1890?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great majority came for the sake of bettering their material\\r\\ncondition. They came here to found a home and to make a living.\\r\\nMoreover, as I have observed above, immigrants in their new home\\r\\ngenerally enter the same pursuits and engage in the same occupations in\\r\\nwhich they were engaged in their native country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree-fourths of the population of Norway live in the rural districts\\r\\nand are mostly engaged in some form of farming.[16] Thus seventy-two\\r\\nper cent of the Norwegian immigrants are found in the rural districts\\r\\nand in towns with less than twenty-five thousand population. The fact\\r\\nthat the influx of the immigrants from Norway coincided with the\\r\\nopening up of the middle western states resulted in the settlement of\\r\\nthose states by Norwegian immigrants. Land could be had for almost\\r\\nnothing in the West. Land-seekers from New England, New York and\\r\\nPennsylvania were in those days flocking to the West.[17] About ninety\\r\\nper cent of the Norwegian immigrants at that time were land-seekers. As\\r\\na rule long before he emigrated the Norseman had made up his mind to\\r\\nsettle in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, or Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [16] This includes also fishermen and foresters.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [17] Outside of Chicago, Illinois had in 1840 a population of\\r\\n       142,210; Wisconsin was organized as a Territory in 1836, its\\r\\n       population in 1840 was 30,945; Iowa had a population of only\\r\\n       192,212 in 1850; and Minnesota, organized at a Territory in\\r\\n       1849, had in 1850, 1,056 inhabitants. To the square mile the\\r\\n       population of each was in 1850: Illinois, 15.37; Wisconsin,\\r\\n       5.66; Iowa, 3.77; Minnesota, .04.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n       _The Earliest Immigrants from Norway, 1620 to 1825._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur data regarding Norwegian emigration to America prior to 1825\\r\\nare very fragmentary, but it is possible to trace that emigration\\r\\nas far back as 1624.[18] In that year a small colony of Norwegians\\r\\nwas established in New Jersey on the site of the present city of\\r\\nBergen.[19] While it is not known that the names of any of these first\\r\\ncolonists have come down to us, we do have the name of one Norwegian,\\r\\nwho visited the American coast on a voyage of exploration in the year\\r\\n1619, that is, the year before the landing of the _Mayflower_. In the\\r\\nearly part of 1619 King Christian IV of Denmark fitted out two ships\\r\\nfor the purpose of finding a northwest passage to Asia. The names of\\r\\nthe ships were _Eenhjörningen_ and _Lampreren_, and the commander was\\r\\na Norwegian, Jens Munk, who was born at Barby, Norway, in 1579. With\\r\\nsixty-six men Jens Munk sailed from Copenhagen, May ninth, 1619. During\\r\\nthe autumn of that year and the early part of the following year he\\r\\nexplored Hudson Bay and took possession of the surrounding country in\\r\\nthe name of King Christian, calling it Nova Dania. The expedition\\r\\nwas, however, a failure, and all but three of the party perished\\r\\nfrom disease and exposure to cold in the winter of 1620. The three\\r\\nsurvivors, among whom was the commander, Jens Munk, returned to Norway\\r\\nin September, 1620.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [18] The Vinland voyages in the 11th-14th centuries do not come\\r\\n       within the scope of our discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [19] It seems that this city was so named by the colonists after\\r\\n       the city of Bergen, Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [20] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_, p. 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the New Netherlands colony, Norwegians sometimes\\r\\ncame across in Dutch ships and settled among the Dutch. The names of\\r\\nat least two such have been preserved in the Dutch colonial records.\\r\\nThey are Hans Hansen and Claes Carstensen (possibly originally Klaus\\r\\nKristenson). The former emigrated in a Dutch ship in 1633 and joined\\r\\nthe Dutch colony in New Amsterdam. His name appears in the colonial\\r\\nrecords variously as Hans Noorman, Hans Hansen de Noorman, Hans Bergen,\\r\\nHans Hansen von Bergen, and Hans Hansen von Bergen in Norwegen. Hans\\r\\nBergen became the ancestor of a large American family by that name.[21]\\r\\nClaes Carstensen\\'s name appears variously as Claes Noorman, Claes\\r\\nCarstensen Noorman and Claes Van Sant, the latter being the Norwegian\\r\\nname Sande in Jarlsberg, where Claes Carstenson was born, 1607. He came\\r\\nto America about 1640 and settled a few years later on fifty-eight\\r\\nacres of land on the site of the present Williamsburg. The ministerial\\r\\nrecords of the old Dutch Reformed Church in New York state that Claes\\r\\nCarstensen was married April 15, 1646, to Helletje Hendricks. The\\r\\nlatter was, it seems, a sister of Annecken Hendricks, who was there\\r\\nmarried on February first, 1650, to Jan Arentzen van der Bilt, the\\r\\ncolonial ancestor of Commodore Vanderbilt. Annecken Hendricks is\\r\\nfurther designated as being from Bergen, Norway, the names \"Helletje\"\\r\\nand \"Annecken\" being Dutch diminutive forms of the Norwegian Helen and\\r\\nAnne. Claes Carstensen died November sixth, 1679.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [21] See _The Bergen Family_, by Teunis Bergen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the year 1700 there were a number of families of Norwegian and\\r\\nDanish descent living in New York. In 1704 a stone church was erected\\r\\nby them on the corner of Broadway and Rector Streets. The property was\\r\\nlater sold to Trinity Church, the present churchyard occupying the site\\r\\nof the original church.[22] Prof. R. B. Anderson, speaking of these\\r\\npeople, says, that they were probably mostly Norwegians and not Danes,\\r\\nfor those of their descendants with whom he has spoken have all claimed\\r\\nNorwegian descent. The pastor who ministered to the spiritual wants of\\r\\nthis first Scandinavian Lutheran congregation in America was a Dane by\\r\\nthe name of Rasmus Jensen Aarhus. He died on the southwest coast of\\r\\nHudson Bay, February twentieth, 1720.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [22] Our authority here is Rev. Rasmus Anderson, who has given this\\r\\n       subject much study.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1740 Norwegian Moravians took part in the founding of a Moravian\\r\\ncolony at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in 1747 of one at Bethabara,\\r\\nNorth Carolina. At Bethlehem these Norwegian (and Swedish and Danish)\\r\\nMoravians came in contact with their kinsmen, the Swedish Lutherans of\\r\\nDelaware and adjoining parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Swedes\\r\\non the Delaware had lost their independence in 1656. New Sweden as a\\r\\npolitical state existed but sixteen years. Ecclesiastically, however,\\r\\nthe Lutherans of New Sweden remained subject to the state church at\\r\\nhome for one hundred and fifty years more, and linguistically the\\r\\ncolony was Swedish nearly as long. In the church records of this colony\\r\\nthere appear not a few Norwegian names, particularly in the later\\r\\nperiod. We know that Norwegians in considerable numbers came to America\\r\\nand joined the Delaware Swedes in the eighteenth century. Gothenburg,\\r\\nwhich lies not far distant from the province of Smaalenene, was at the\\r\\ntime, and has continued to be, the regular Swedish sailing port for\\r\\nAmerica-bound ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most prominent members of the Bethabara Colony was Dr. John\\r\\nM. Calberlane, born 1722 in Trondhjem, Norway. He came to New York in\\r\\n1753, having sailed from London on the ship _Irene_, June thirteenth,\\r\\narriving on September ninth. Dr. Calberlane\\'s name occupies a foremost\\r\\nplace among the old colonial physicians; he was a man of much ability,\\r\\nnoble in character and untiring in his devotion to the welfare of his\\r\\nfellow colonists. On July twenty-eighth, 1759, he himself succumbed to\\r\\na contagious fever that visited the settlement. In a sermon delivered\\r\\non Easter Sunday, 1760, Bishop Spangenberg gave public recognition of\\r\\nCalberlane\\'s service in his short life of six years in the colony.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [23] The name John M. Calberlane, originally Hans Martin Kalberlahn,\\r\\n       is an interesting instance of an early Americanization of a\\r\\n       Norwegian name.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Norwegians among these Moravian colonists were: Susanna\\r\\nStokkeberg, from Söndmöre, Norway, born 1715, who came to America in\\r\\n1744 with her husband, Abraham Reinke, a Swede, to whom she had been\\r\\nmarried that year in Stockholm. Reinke is reputed to have been an able\\r\\npreacher of the gospel, the two laboring together in the congregations\\r\\nof Bethlehem, Nazareth, Philadelphia, and Lancaster. She died in 1758,\\r\\nhe in 1760, leaving a son, Abraham Reinke. Peter Peterson, who was\\r\\nborn in Norway in 1728, and had joined the church in London, came to\\r\\nAmerica as a sailor on the ship _Irene_ in 1749. He died in 1750.\\r\\nJens Wittenberg, a tanner from Christiania, born 1719, came on the\\r\\n_Irene_ in 1754; he died in the colony, 1788. Martha Mans (probably\\r\\nMonsdatter), from Bergen, born 1716, came on the _Irene_ in 1749. She\\r\\nlived in Bethabara as a teacher and religious adviser until 1773.\\r\\nAt the same time, also, came Enert Enerson, a carpenter, while in\\r\\n1759 came Catherine Kalberlahn, and in 1762 Christian Christensen, a\\r\\nshoemaker, from Christiana. The latter was born in 1718; he had lived\\r\\nsome years in Holland before coming to America. The year of his death\\r\\nis 1777. Erik Ingebretsen came over June twenty-second, 1750, via\\r\\nDover, having been on the ocean six weeks, a remarkably short passage\\r\\nfor that time.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [24] For some of these facts I am indebted to Juul Dieserud,\\r\\n       Washington, D. C.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of several Norwegians are recorded who served in the War of\\r\\nthe Revolution. Thus under John Paul Jones served Thomas Johnson, who\\r\\nwas born 1758, the son of a pilot in Mandal, Norway. The _New England\\r\\nHistorical Register_, Volume XXVIII, pages 18-21, gives an account\\r\\nof Johnson\\'s career in the American marine, from which we learn that\\r\\nhe was among those who served on board the _Bon Homme Richard_ in\\r\\nher cruise in 1779, having been transferred by Paul Jones from the\\r\\n_Ranger_. Later he went with Paul Jones to the _Serapis_ and the\\r\\n_Alliance_ and finally to the _Ariel_. With the last ship he arrived\\r\\nin Philadelphia February eighteenth, 1781. For a fuller account of\\r\\nJohnson\\'s career the interested reader is referred to the source of\\r\\nwhich mention has already been made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Johnson lived to the good old age of ninety-three, dying July\\r\\ntwelfth, 1807, in the United States Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.\\r\\nHe had been a pensionist here for a number of years, being known\\r\\ngenerally by the nickname \"Paul Jones.\" A biography of Johnson written\\r\\nby John Henry Sherburne was published at Washington in 1825, to which I\\r\\nhave, however, not had access. Another Norwegian by the name of Lewis\\r\\nBrown (Lars Bruun) also served under John Paul Jones. I lack further\\r\\nparticulars, however, regarding Brown, except that he is spoken of in\\r\\nSherburne\\'s book, _Life of Thomas Johnson_.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Norwegian sailor, Captain Iverson, settled in Georgia some time about\\r\\nthe close of the eighteenth century. United States Senator Iverson from\\r\\nGeorgia was a grandson of this Norwegian sailor pioneer in Georgia.[25]\\r\\nAbout 1805 another sailor, Torgus Torkelson Gromstu, from Gjerpen, near\\r\\nSkien, Norway, settled in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [25] P. S. Vig in his book _De Danske i Amerika_ says Iverson was\\r\\n       of Danish descent but gives no reasons for the claim. As the\\r\\n       name \"Iver\" is peculiarly Norwegian I must therefore adhere to\\r\\n       my view as formerly expressed (_Sc. Immig. to Iowa_).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my article on \"The Danish Contingent in the Population of Early\\r\\nIowa,\" _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, 1906, I spoke of a\\r\\nsociety, styling itself _Scandinavia_, as having been organized in New\\r\\nYork City on June twenty-seventh, 1844. I there designated this as the\\r\\nearliest organization of the kind in this country. This I find now\\r\\nto be incorrect. As early as 1769 the _Societas Scandinaviensis_ was\\r\\nfounded in Philadelphia. The membership of this society was made up of\\r\\nSwedes, Norwegians and Danes, the first of these presumably being in\\r\\nthe majority. The first president of the society was Abraham Markoe\\r\\n(Markö), a Norwegian. One of the memorable events in the history of the\\r\\nsociety was a farewell reception given in \"City Tavern\" on December\\r\\neleventh, 1782, in honor of Baron Axel Ferson, hero of the Battle of\\r\\nYorktown. The committee of seven appointed to present the invitation\\r\\nand also to wait upon General George Washington at Hasbrouch House,\\r\\nNewburg, with a view of securing his presence consisted of the\\r\\nfollowing: Captain Abraham Markoe, Sakarias Paulsen, Andreasen\\r\\nTaasinge, Rev. Andrew Goeranson, Jacob Van der Weer, John Stille and\\r\\nAndrew Keen. Says the chronicler of the event:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"This event was one of the most glorious in the Society\\'s history.\\r\\n  The reception was held at the City Tavern, Wednesday evening,\\r\\n  December eleventh, 1782. The President of the St. Andrew\\'s Society,\\r\\n  Rev. Wm. Smith, D. D., lauded the bravery of the Baron and his men\\r\\n  at the Battle of Yorktown, whereupon General Washington in thanking\\r\\n  the members of the Society for their forethought in tendering\\r\\n  the reception to the noble officer (he subsequently decorated\\r\\n  Ferson with the \"Order of the Cincinnati\" for valor displayed)\\r\\n  expressed his pleasure at being present among the people of his\\r\\n  forefathers\\' blood, as he claimed descent from the family of Wass,\\r\\n  who emigrated from Denmark in the year A. D. 970, and settled in\\r\\n  the County Durham, England, where they built a small town, calling\\r\\n  it Wass-in-ga-tun (town of Wass.)\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [26] Cited from a prospectus of the Society issued in December, 1901,\\r\\n       and kindly sent me by C. M. Machold of Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariant forms of the name Wassingatun are, as given in the prospectus,\\r\\nWessington, Whessingtone, Wasengtone, Wassington and finally\\r\\nWashington. The prospectus itself cites from Machold\\'s _History of the\\r\\nScandinavians in Pennsylvania_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, 1783, General George Washington was elected honorary member\\r\\nof the Society on account of his Norse ancestry. On the twenty-sixth\\r\\nof August, that year, a banquet was given at the City Tavern under\\r\\nthe auspices of the Society, in celebration of the recognition by\\r\\nSweden, Norway, and Denmark of the independence of the United States of\\r\\nAmerica. John Stille was for many years secretary of the Society; after\\r\\nhis death in 1802 all traces of it seem to have vanished. Just when the\\r\\nSocieties Scandinaviensis ceased to exist, the Historian cannot say. On\\r\\nFebruary twentieth, 1868, eighteen gentlemen, all of Scandinavian birth\\r\\nand residents of Philadelphia, met together for the purpose of forming\\r\\na society, and _The Scandinavian Society of Philadelphia_ was founded,\\r\\nan organization which regards itself a continuation of the original\\r\\nsociety. The chief object of the Society is benevolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of at least one Norwegian who fell in the early wars against\\r\\nthe Indians has come down to us. Frank Peterson, who had enlisted on\\r\\nthe fifteenth of June, 1808, was among those who fell at Fort Dearborn\\r\\nin 1812, among the \"first martyrs of the West,\" in an attack by five\\r\\nhundred Pottawattamie Indians. In this battle two-thirds of the whites\\r\\nwere killed and the rest taken prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a later date some other names also appear, but those given are the\\r\\nonly ones of which we have any record. I shall mention here that of Ole\\r\\nHaugen, who probably was the first Norwegian to settle in the State of\\r\\nMassachusetts. Haugen was from Bergen, Norway, and located in Middlesex\\r\\nCounty, that state, in 1815. Alexander Paaske, himself an early\\r\\nimmigrant from Bergen, living in Lowell, Mass., and who was present\\r\\nat Haugen\\'s deathbed, is the source of the above fact. Though going\\r\\nbeyond the scope of our brief survey of this earliest immigration, it\\r\\nmay be of interest here to know that as early as 1817, a girl from\\r\\nVoss, Norway, Anna Vetlahuso, emigrated to America with her husband, a\\r\\nGerman sailor in Bergen, and settled somewhere in South America. The\\r\\nnext recorded names in the order of emigration to the United States\\r\\nare Kleng Peerson and Knud Olson Eide, who in 1821 became the advance\\r\\nguard of a group of fifty-two emigrants that in 1825 founded the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in this country. It is of this sailing and the\\r\\nleaders of this group that I now wish to speak; of Peerson I shall give\\r\\na brief account below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Sloopers of 1825. The First Norwegian Settlement\\r\\n                      in America. Kleng Peerson._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the Sloopers from Stavanger, Norway, who came to America\\r\\nin 1825, has often been told; I shall therefore be very brief in my\\r\\naccount of that expedition. Under causes of emigration I shall have\\r\\noccasion below to note briefly some of the circumstances that seem to\\r\\nhave led to their departure for America in that year. The director\\r\\nof the expedition and the chief owner of the boat was Lars Larson i\\r\\nJeilane; the captain was Lars Olsen. The company consisted of fifty-two\\r\\npersons, all but one being natives of Stavanger and vicinity; the one\\r\\nexception was the mate, Nels Erikson, who came from Bergen. Relative\\r\\nto the leading spirit in this first group of emigrants, Lars Larson, I\\r\\nshall say here: He was born near Stavanger, September twenty-fourth,\\r\\n1787. He became a sailor, was captured in the Napoleonic wars and\\r\\nkept a prisoner in London for seven years. Being released in 1814,\\r\\nhe remained in London, however, till 1815, when he and several other\\r\\nprisoners returned to Norway. In London they had been converted to the\\r\\nQuaker faith by Mrs. Margaret Allen, and upon returning to Stavanger,\\r\\nLars Larson, Elias Tastad, Thomas Helle and Metta Helle became the\\r\\nfounders of the first Quaker society in that city, a society which is\\r\\nstill in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1821 the Stavanger Quakers began to form plans for emigrating to\\r\\nAmerica. It seems that Kleng Peerson and Knud Eide, whom we have\\r\\nmentioned above, were deputed to go to America for the purpose of\\r\\nlearning something of the country with a view to planting there a\\r\\nQuaker colony. Kleng Peerson returned to Stavanger in 1824 with a\\r\\nfavorable report and many of the members of the Quaker colony began to\\r\\nmake preparations for emigrating to the locality selected by Peerson,\\r\\nnamely, Orleans County, New York State. A sloop of only forty-five\\r\\ntons capacity which they called _Restaurationen_, built in Hardanger,\\r\\nwas purchased and loaded with a cargo of iron and made ready for the\\r\\njourney. Larson himself had married in December, 1824, Georgiana\\r\\nPerson, who was born October 19, 1803, on Fogn, a small island near\\r\\nStavanger. Besides him there were five other heads of families. On\\r\\nthe fourth of July, 1825, they set sail from Stavanger. The following\\r\\nfifty-two persons made up the party: Lars Larson and wife Martha\\r\\nGeorgiana; Lars Olson, who was captain of the boat, Cornelius Nelson\\r\\nHersdal, wife and four children;[27] Daniel Stenson Rossadal, wife and\\r\\nfive children;[28] Thomas Madland, wife and three children,[29] Nels\\r\\nNelson Hersdal and wife Bertha, Knud Anderson Slogvig, Jacob Anderson\\r\\nSlogvig, Gudmund Haugaas, Johannes Stene, wife and two children, Öien\\r\\nThorson (Thompson) wife and three children,[30] Simon Lima, wife and\\r\\nthree children, Henrik Christopherson Hervig, and wife, Ole Johnson,\\r\\nGeorge Johnson, Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Nels Thorson, Ole Olson\\r\\nHetletvedt, Sara Larson (sister of Lars Larson), Halvor Iverson, Andrew\\r\\nStangeland, the mate, Nels Erikson, and the cook, Endre Dahl.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [27] Anne (b. 1814), Nels (b. 1816), Inger (b. 1819), and Martha\\r\\n       (b. 1823).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [28] Ellen (b. 1807), Ove (b. 1809), Lars (b. 1812), John (b.\\r\\n       1821), Hulda (b. 1825).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [29] Rachel (b. 1807), Julia (b. 1810), Senena (b. 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [30] Sara (b. 1818), Anna Maria (b. 1819), Caroline (b. 1825).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a perilous voyage of fourteen weeks they landed in New York,\\r\\nOctober ninth. An account of that voyage, which also it seems was a\\r\\nrather adventurous one, was given by the New York papers at the time;\\r\\nit was reproduced in Norwegian translation in _Billed-Magazin_ in\\r\\n1869, whence it has been copied in other works. The arrival of this\\r\\nfirst party of Norwegian immigrants, and in so small a boat, created\\r\\nnothing less than a sensation at the time, as we may infer from the\\r\\nwide attention the event received in the eastern press. Thus the _New\\r\\nYork Daily Advertiser_ for October twelfth, 1825, under the head lines,\\r\\n\"A Novel Sight,\" gives an account of the boat, the destination of the\\r\\nimmigrants, the country they came from, their appearance, etc. For\\r\\nthis citation I may refer the reader to page 39 of my article on \"The\\r\\nComing of the Norwegians to Iowa\" in _The Iowa Journal of History and\\r\\nPolitics_, 1905, or to R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter of Norwegian\\r\\nImmigration_, 1896, 70-71.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New York the immigrants met Mr. Joseph Fellows, a Quaker, from whom\\r\\nthey purchased land in Orleans County, New York. It seems to have been\\r\\nupon the suggestion of Mr. Fellows that they were induced to settle\\r\\nhere, although it is possible that the land had already been selected\\r\\nfor them by Kleng Peerson, who was in New York at the time. The price\\r\\nto be paid for the land was five dollars an acre, each head of a family\\r\\nand adult person purchasing forty acres. The immigrants not being able\\r\\nto pay for the land, Mr. Fellows agreed to let them redeem it in ten\\r\\nannual installments. For the further history of the colony, with which\\r\\nwe are here not so much concerned, the reader is referred to Knud\\r\\nLangeland\\'s _Nordmaendene i Amerika_, Chicago, 1889, pp. 10-19, or to\\r\\nAnderson\\'s _First Chapter_, pp. 77-90.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already mentioned Kleng Peerson, a name familiar to every\\r\\nstudent of Norwegian pioneer history. Much has been written about\\r\\nthis pathfinder in the West, and romance and legend already adorn his\\r\\nmemory. It would be interesting to recount what we know of his life in\\r\\nAmerica, but as this has been dealt with at length by Professor R. B.\\r\\nAnderson in his monograph on Norwegian Immigration, which is in large\\r\\npart devoted to the slooper\\'s history, I may refer the interested\\r\\nreader to this work. _Symra_ (Decorah, Iowa) for 1906 also contains a\\r\\nbrief, somewhat eulogistic account in Norwegian of Peerson\\'s stay in\\r\\nNew York and his journey of exploration to Illinois, Missouri, and\\r\\nTexas. The briefest facts I may, however, relate here.\\r\\n\\r\\nKleng Peerson was born on the seventeenth of May, 1782, on the estate\\r\\nHesthammer in Tysvær Parish, Province of Ryfylke. In 1820 we find\\r\\nhim in Stavanger, where William Allen, an English Quaker, was then\\r\\norganizing a Quaker society. In 1821 Kleng Peerson and a certain Knud\\r\\nOlson Eide were, as we have seen, commissioned, it appears, by the\\r\\nQuakers to go to America and examine the possibility of organizing a\\r\\nNorwegian colony there. The two explorers secured work in New York\\r\\nCity, but Knud Eide fell ill and died not long after, and Peerson went\\r\\nwest alone in quest of a suitable location for a colony. Just how far\\r\\nwest he may have come on this first journey is not known. After some\\r\\ntime he decided upon Orleans County on the shores of the Ontario as the\\r\\nbest place to plant his colony, and in 1824 he returned to Norway. We\\r\\nhave noted already the results of Peerson\\'s mission. When Lars Larson\\'s\\r\\nparty prepared to go to America Kleng Peerson also left, but he did\\r\\nnot take passage in _Restaurationen_. It seems that he embarked by way\\r\\nof Gothenburg and was in New York to receive the sloopers upon their\\r\\narrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be natural to suppose that Peerson did not go alone from\\r\\nStavanger when he returned to America via Gothenburg in 1825. After\\r\\nmuch inquiry I have also succeeded in discovering the name of one man,\\r\\nwho, with his family, accompanied Peerson that year. This man was\\r\\nBjörn Björnson from Stavanger, a cousin of Kleng Peerson; he brought\\r\\nhis wife and several children with him, but left two girl twins, born\\r\\nin May of that year, with a relative who then lived in Tjensvold, near\\r\\nStavanger. Further facts about this family will be given in the chapter\\r\\non Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Peerson seems to play no role in the founding of the Orleans County\\r\\nsettlement, I shall leave him here. There will be occasion to speak\\r\\nbriefly of him again later in connection with the second Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement. I wish to add a few words here about Lars Larson, however.\\r\\nHe and his family located in Rochester, where he became a builder\\r\\nof canal boats, prospered; and kept in close touch with immigrant\\r\\nNorwegians during the two decades of his life there. His home became a\\r\\nkind of Mecca for hosts of intending settlers in the New World. Larson\\r\\ndied by accident on a canal boat in November, 1845, but his widow lived\\r\\ntill October, 1887. They had eight children, of whom the first one,\\r\\nMargaret Allen, was born on the Atlantic Ocean, September second, 1825.\\r\\nOf her and others of Lars Larson\\'s descendants I shall speak briefly\\r\\nbelow. We shall now return to the settlers in Orleans County, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony was in many respects unfortunate; it cannot be said to\\r\\nhave prospered and has never played any important part as a colony in\\r\\nNorwegian-American history. But it is important as being the first,\\r\\nand also as being the parent of a very large and progressive Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement founded in 1834-35 in La Salle County, Illinois, of which\\r\\nmore below. And yet the economic conditions of the Quaker immigrants\\r\\ngradually became better and the future looked more promising. They felt\\r\\nnow that America offered many advantages to the able and the capable,\\r\\nand they began writing encouraging letters to relatives and friends in\\r\\nthe old country, urging them to seek their fortune here. As a result\\r\\nthere was, if not a large, at any rate a fairly constant emigration\\r\\nof individuals and families from Stavanger and adjacent region during\\r\\nthe following eight or nine years, although few seem to have come\\r\\nbefore 1829. In this year, e. g., came Gudmund Sandsberg (b. 1787) from\\r\\nHjelmeland, in Ryfylke, Norway, and his wife Marie and three children,\\r\\nBertha, Anna, and Torbjör.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassage was secured in the beginning for the most part with American\\r\\nsailships carrying Swedish iron from Gothenburg. But as this was\\r\\nattended by much uncertainty, often necessitating several weeks of\\r\\nwaiting, the intending emigrants began to go to Hamburg, where German\\r\\nemigration by means of regular going American packet ships had already\\r\\nbegun. Here, however, another difficulty met them. The already somewhat\\r\\nheavy emigration at this port made it necessary to order passage\\r\\nseveral weeks ahead in order to insure accommodations, and failing in\\r\\nthis, the emigrant was forced to wait there until the next packet boat\\r\\nshould sail. And so it came about that many of the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants to America came by way of Havre, France, where passage was\\r\\nalways certain, emigration from this point being as yet very limited.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came via Gothenburg was Gjert Hovland, a farmer from\\r\\nHardanger, who left Norway with his family on the twenty-fourth of\\r\\nJune, 1831, sailed from Gothenburg June thirtieth and arrived in New\\r\\nYork September eighteenth. He does not seem to have gone directly to\\r\\nKendall, for we find him soon after the owner of fifty acres of forest\\r\\nland in Morris County, New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nGjert Hovland seems to be the first one from the province of Hardanger\\r\\nto emigrate to America. Other emigrants during these years are:\\r\\nChristian Olson, who came in 1829, settling in Kendall; Knut Evenson,\\r\\nwife and daughter Katherine, who emigrated in 1831 in the same ship\\r\\nby which Hovland came; and Ingebret Larson Narvig from Tysvær Parish,\\r\\nRyfylke, who came in 1831 and two years later located in Michigan.\\r\\nIt seems probable that also Johan Nordboe and wife from Ringebo, in\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen, Norway, came to Orleans County in 1832. Nordboe was the\\r\\nfirst to emigrate from Gudbrandsdalen, a province from which actual\\r\\nimmigration did not begin until sixteen years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants who came during these years generally located\\r\\nin Orleans County, but rarely remained there permanently. The\\r\\nnorthwestern states were just then beginning to be opened up to\\r\\nsettlers. At this time migration from the eastern states was directed\\r\\nparticularly to Illinois. Good government land could be had here\\r\\nfor $1.25 an acre. The very heavily wooded land that the Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants in Orleans County had purchased proved very difficult of\\r\\nimprovement, and many began to think of moving to a more favorable\\r\\nlocality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1833 Kleng Peerson, who seems to have lived in Kendall at this\\r\\ntime, made a journey to the West, evidently for the purpose of finding\\r\\na suitable site for a new settlement. He was accompanied by Ingebret\\r\\nLarson Narvig as far as Erie, Monroe County, Michigan, where the latter\\r\\nremained, Peerson continuing the journey farther west. After several\\r\\nmonths of wandering across Michigan, and down into Ohio and Indiana, he\\r\\nat last arrived at Chicago, then a village of about twenty huts. The\\r\\nmarshes of Chicago did not appeal to Peerson and he went to Milwaukee,\\r\\nbut the reports he received of the endless forests of Wisconsin soon\\r\\ndrove him back again into Illinois. After several days\\' journey on foot\\r\\nagain west of Chicago he at last found a spot which seemed to him as\\r\\nif providentially designated as the proper locality for his western\\r\\ncolony. The place was immediately south of the present village of\\r\\nNorway in La Salle County. His choice made, Peerson returned to Orleans\\r\\nCounty, having covered over 2,000 miles on foot since he left.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeerson\\'s selection was universally approved and a considerable\\r\\nnumber of the Kendall settlers decided to move west. Among those of\\r\\nthe sloopers who remained in New York I shall here name: Ole Johnson,\\r\\nHenrik C. Hervig and Andrew Stangeland, who, however, some years later\\r\\nbought a tract of land in Noble County, Indiana; Lars Olson located in\\r\\nNew York City, and, as we have seen, Lars Larson settled in Rochester;\\r\\nNels Erikson went back to Norway, while Öien Thompson and Thomas\\r\\nMadland died in Kendall in 1826, and Cornelius Hersdal died there in\\r\\n1833.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n               _The Founding of the Fox River Settlement.\\r\\n                Personal Notes on Some of the Founders._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1834 Jacob Anderson Slogvig, Knud Anderson Slogvig,\\r\\nGudmund Haugaas, Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Nels Thompson,[31] Andrew\\r\\n(Endre) Dahl, and Kleng Peerson left for La Salle County; they became,\\r\\ntherefore, as far as we know, the first Norwegian settlers in Illinois,\\r\\nand indeed in the Northwest, barring Ingebret Narvig, who had located\\r\\nin Michigan the year before. These men selected their land and\\r\\nperfected their purchase as soon as it came into market the following\\r\\nspring. The first two to buy land were Jacob Slogvig and Gudmund\\r\\nHaugaas, whose purchase is recorded under June fifteenth, 1835, the\\r\\nformer of eighty acres, the latter one hundred and sixty acres, both\\r\\nin that part of what was then called Mission Township, but later came\\r\\nto be Rutland. On June seventeenth, Kleng Peerson\\'s purchase of eighty\\r\\nacres is recorded, as also that of his sister, Carrie Nelson, widow of\\r\\nCornelius Nelson Hersdal, namely, eighty acres of land bought for her\\r\\nby Peerson. For this date are also recorded the purchases of Thorsten\\r\\nOlson Bjaaland, eighty acres, Nels Thompson, one hundred and sixty\\r\\nacres, in what later became Miller Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [31] Nels Thompson had married Bertha Caroline, the widow of\\r\\n       Olen Thompson in 1827. She had three daughters by her first\\r\\n       husband: Sara, born 1818; Anna, born 1819; and Caroline, born\\r\\n       1825 (died in Rochester, N. Y., 1826). Nels Thompson and wife\\r\\n       had two children: Serena, born 1828; Abraham, born 1830; and\\r\\n       Caroline, born in 1833.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1835 Daniel Rossadal and family, Nels Nelson Hersdal, George\\r\\nJohnson, and Carrie Nelson Hersdal with family of seven children moved\\r\\nto La Salle County. Nels Hersdal secured six hundred and forty acres in\\r\\nexchange for one hundred acres he owned in Orleans County, New York.\\r\\nThe slooper Thomas Madland, as we have seen, died in 1826; his widow\\r\\nand family of seven also moved to Illinois in 1831. Gjert Hovland came\\r\\nin 1835, and on June seventeenth purchased one hundred and sixty acres\\r\\nof land in Miller Township. Nels Hersdal purchased on September fifth\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland\\'s eighty acres in the same township; the latter,\\r\\nhowever, bought a hundred and sixty acres again on January sixteenth,\\r\\n1836, in the same locality. The record of these purchases was copied by\\r\\nR. B. Anderson and printed in his book, _First Chapter_, etc., cited\\r\\nabove and also in Strand\\'s _History of the Norwegians of Illinois_,\\r\\npage 75.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnud Slogvig, who, as we see, came in 1834, did not buy land but\\r\\nsomewhat later returned east and in 1835 went back to Norway. There\\r\\nhe married a sister of the slooper, Ole Olson Hetletvedt and, as\\r\\nwe shall have occasion to note under causes of emigration, became\\r\\nlargely instrumental in bringing about the emigration of 1836.\\r\\nBaldwin\\'s _History of La Salle County_ also states, page 74, that\\r\\nOliver Canuteson,[32] Oliver Knutson,[32] Christian Olson, and Ole\\r\\nOlson Hetletvedt came to the county in 1834, but the date seems to be\\r\\nuncertain. With regard to Christian Olson the fact seems rather to be\\r\\nthat he came in 1836 or possibly not till 1837, while also Hetletvedt\\r\\nseems to be dated about two years too early here. Among those who\\r\\ncame in 1836 according to apparently reliable records are: Ole Olson\\r\\nHetletvedt and Gudmund Sandsberg.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [32] Or are these two the same person?\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative to the founders of the Fox River Settlement, as that of La\\r\\nSalle County came to be called, I wish to add here the following\\r\\nfacts of personal history: Gudmund Haugaas, one of the two first to\\r\\nrecord the purchase of land, had married Julia, the daughter of Thomas\\r\\nMadland, in Orleans County in 1827. She died in Rutland Township, La\\r\\nSalle County, in 1846 and he later married Caroline Hervig, a sister\\r\\nof Henrik Hervig (Harwick). He had ten children by his first wife.\\r\\nIn Illinois he joined the Mormon Church and became an elder in that\\r\\nchurch, practicing medicine at the same time, and, it is said, with\\r\\nmuch success. He died of the cholera on the homestead near Norway in\\r\\nJuly, 1849; his widow, Caroline, survived him three years.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [33] Mrs. R. W. Bower of Sheridan, Illinois, is a daughter of\\r\\n       Haugaas and his wife Caroline. Other children of his are\\r\\n       Daniel Haugaas in Henderson, Iowa, and Mrs. Isabel Lewis,\\r\\n       Emington, Illinois, and Thomas Haugaas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJacob Slogvig married Serena, daughter of Thomas Madland, in March,\\r\\n1831. He became one of the founders of the Norwegian settlement in Lee\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, in 1840 (see below), later went to California, where\\r\\nhe died in May, 1864. The widow lived until about 1897. Some time\\r\\nbefore her death she had been living at the home of her son, Andrew J.\\r\\nAnderson, at San Diego, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Carrie Nelson had seven children, of whom Anne, Nels, Inger, and\\r\\nMartha were born in Norway; Sarah, Peter, and Amelia were born at\\r\\nKendall, New York. Carrie Nelson died in 1848. The son, Nels Nelson,\\r\\nborn 1816, married Catherine Iverson about 1840; he died in Sheridan,\\r\\nIllinois, in August, 1893, as the last male member of the sloop party,\\r\\nbeing survived by his widow and four of twelve children. The daughter\\r\\nInger was in 1836 married to John S. Mitchell, of Ottawa, Illinois;\\r\\nMartha married Beach Fallows, a settler of 1835, and Sarah married in\\r\\n1849 Canute Marsett, an immigrant of 1837, who some years later became\\r\\na Mormon bishop at Ephraim, Utah. Their oldest son, Peter Cornelius\\r\\nMarsett, born at Salt Lake City June second, 1850, was the first child\\r\\nborn of Norwegian parents in Utah.[34] Peter C. Nelson, the youngest\\r\\nson of Carrie Nelson, born 1830, later settled in Larned, Kansas, where\\r\\nhe died in 1904. Sara Thompson, oldest daughter of Öien Thompson,\\r\\nand born 1818, married George Olmstead in 1857 in La Salle County;\\r\\nhe died in 1849, and in 1855 she married William W. Richey. Mrs.\\r\\nRichey settled in Guthrie Center, Iowa, in 1882, where she lived until\\r\\nrecently. Benson C. Olmsted, Charles B. Olmsted and Will F. Richey of\\r\\nGuthrie Center, Iowa, are sons of Mrs. Sara Richey. Nels Thompson died\\r\\nin La Salle County, Illinois, in July, 1863. Daniel Rossadal and his\\r\\nwife, Bertha, both died in La Salle County in 1854. Nels Nelson Hersdal\\r\\nwas born in July, 1800, and his wife, Bertha, in May, 1804; they were\\r\\nmarried a few months before the departure of the sloop. He, \"Big Nels\",\\r\\nas he was called, came to Illinois in 1835, returned to New York and\\r\\ndid not bring his family to Illinois until 1846, though he moved west\\r\\nbefore. He lived until 1886, his wife having died in 1882. Peter Nelson\\r\\nand Ira Nelson of La Salle County, are their sons. George Johnson died\\r\\nfrom cholera in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [34] For these facts I am indebted to R. B. Anderson, as also\\r\\n       for other details of the personal history of the slooper\\'s\\r\\n       descendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Dahl went to Utah in the fifties, being one of the earliest\\r\\npioneers of that state. A son of his, A. S. Anderson, was a member\\r\\nof the Utah Constitutional Convention in 1895. Ole Hetletvedt, who\\r\\nlocated at Niagara Falls, not therefore in Orleans County, had three\\r\\nsons, Porter C., Sören L. and James W. The first of these, born 1831,\\r\\nbecame captain and later colonel in Company F, 36th Regiment, Illinois\\r\\nVolunteers, in the War of the Rebellion, and was Acting Brigadier\\r\\nGeneral when he was killed in the Battle of Franklin (Tenn.). Sören\\r\\nOlson was killed in the Battle of Murfreesboro. James Olson, who also\\r\\nwent to the front, lived to return to his home after the war. Porter\\r\\nOlson lies buried at Newark, Illinois, where a fitting monument adorns\\r\\nhis grave. Finally I wish to add that Margaret Allen, the \"sloop girl\"\\r\\nborn on the Atlantic, daughter of Lars Larson, married John Atwater in\\r\\nRochester, New York, in 1857. They afterwards moved to Chicago, where\\r\\nhe died in the early nineties, while Mrs. Atwater is, I believe, still\\r\\nliving at Western Springs, Cook County. We shall now return to our\\r\\nsettlement in La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have given above a brief account of the founding of the Fox River\\r\\nsettlement. Out of that nucleus of about thirty persons, whom we\\r\\nknow to have come there in 1834-35 grew up one of the largest and\\r\\nmost prosperous of rural communities in the country. The settlement\\r\\ndeveloped rapidly, before many years extending into Kendall, Grundy and\\r\\nDeKalb counties and becoming a distributing point in the westward march\\r\\nof Norwegian immigration during the following years. The settlement\\r\\nin Orleans County, New York, ceased to grow, the objective point of\\r\\nimmigrants from Norway had been changed and the Fox River region\\r\\nreceived large accessions, especially during the year 1836.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration from Norway which heretofore had been more or less\\r\\nsporadic, in which individuals and very small groups are found to take\\r\\npart, now enters upon a new phase, begins in fact to assume the form of\\r\\norganized effort. The year 1836 inaugurated this change, while in 1837\\r\\nthere was something approaching an exodus from certain localities in\\r\\nWestern Norway. The desire to emigrate to America had also now spread\\r\\nfar beyond the original center, at Stavanger; the source of emigration\\r\\nwas transferred to a more northerly region and with it, as we have had\\r\\noccasion to observe above, the course of settlement in this country is\\r\\nnot only directed to a more westerly region, Illinois, but also soon\\r\\nextends into the northern border counties of Illinois and into southern\\r\\nand southeastern Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this increased immigration is historically associated with the names\\r\\nof two of those whom we have already met as pioneers in New York, New\\r\\nJersey and Illinois, a brief account of their share in the promotion\\r\\nof immigration from Norway will be in place. These two are Gjert\\r\\nHovland and Knud Slogvig. We have seen that the former of these came\\r\\nto America in 1831, being probably the first immigrant from Hardanger.\\r\\nHis name deserves special mention as an early promoter of emigration\\r\\nfrom southwestern Norway, especially from his own province. He was\\r\\na man of much enlightenment and liberalmindedness to whom America\\'s\\r\\nfree institutions made a strong appeal. He wrote letters home to\\r\\nfriends urging emigration and these were circulated far and wide. In\\r\\none of these letters from Morris County, New Jersey, 1835, he writes\\r\\nenthusiastically of American laws, and he contrasts its spirit of\\r\\nliberty with the oppressions of the class aristocracy in Norway. He\\r\\nadvised all who could do so to come to America, where it was permitted\\r\\nto settle wherever one chose, he says. Hovland was well known in\\r\\nseveral parishes in the Province of South Bergenhus, and hundreds of\\r\\ncopies of his letters were circulated there; they aroused the greatest\\r\\ninterest among the people and were no small factor in leading many in\\r\\nthat region to emigrate in 1836-37.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it may be noted specifically that in 1836 a lay preacher\\r\\ntravelling in Voss had in his possession one of Gjert Hovland\\'s\\r\\nletters, which letter was read by Nils Röthe, Nils Bolstad and John H.\\r\\nBjörgo and others. These three since said that it was the reading of\\r\\nHovland\\'s letter which induced them to immigrate.[35] Gjert Hovland,\\r\\nas we have seen, came to Illinois in 1835. His purchase of one hundred\\r\\nand sixty acres of land in the present Miller Township was recorded\\r\\non June seventeenth of that year, the same date that the purchases of\\r\\nKleng Peerson, Nels Thompson and Thorsten Bjaaland were recorded. Gjert\\r\\nHovland lived there till his death in 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [35] _First Chapter_, p. 331.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other name, that I referred to, is that of Knud Anderson Slogvig,\\r\\nwho undoubtedly was the chief promoter of immigration in 1836. He had\\r\\ncome in the sloop in 1825, and, as we have seen, settled in La Salle\\r\\nCounty in 1834. In 1835 he returned to Skjold, Norway, and there\\r\\nmarried a sister of Ole O. Hetletvedt, the slooper whom we find as one\\r\\nof the early pioneers of La Salle County. While there, people came to\\r\\ntalk with him about America from all parts of southwestern Norway; and\\r\\na large number in and about Stavanger decided to emigrate. Slogvig\\'s\\r\\nreturn may be said to have started the \"America-fever\" in Norway,\\r\\nthough it took some years before it reached the central and the eastern\\r\\nparts of the country. It was his intention to return to America in\\r\\n1836, and a large party was preparing to emigrate with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of that year the two brigs, _Norden_ and _Den Norske\\r\\nKlippe_, were fitted out from Stavanger. The former sailed on the first\\r\\nWednesday after Pentecost, arriving in New York July twelfth, 1836. The\\r\\nlatter sailed a few weeks later. They carried altogether two hundred\\r\\nimmigrants, most of whom went directly to La Salle County. Of these two\\r\\nbrigs I shall speak again in a subsequent chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have above given some of the facts of Knud Slogvig\\'s personal\\r\\nhistory. Having already spoken of one element in the cause of\\r\\nemigration I believe it will be in place to give a fuller account at\\r\\nthis point of the various general and special factors that have been\\r\\ninstrumental in bringing about the coming to America of such a large\\r\\npart of the population of Norway in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n                   _Causes of Emigration from Norway.\\r\\n                      General Factors, Economic._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes that have brought about the exodus from Norway\\r\\nand in general from the Scandinavian countries in the 19th century?\\r\\nThe question is not a simple one to answer; for the causes have been\\r\\nmany and varied, and it would be impossible in the following pages to\\r\\ndiscuss all the circumstances and influences that have operated to\\r\\npromote the northern emigration and directed it to America. Perhaps\\r\\nthere is something in the highly developed migratory instinct of\\r\\nIndo-European peoples. Especially has this instinct characterized the\\r\\nGermanic branch, whether it be Goth or Vandal, Anglo-Saxon, Viking or\\r\\nNorman,[36] or their descendants, the Teutonic peoples of modern times,\\r\\nby whom chiefly the United States has been peopled and developed.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [36] That is, \"Northman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf tangible motives, one that has everywhere been a fundamental\\r\\nfactor in promoting emigration from European countries in modern\\r\\ntimes has been the prospect of material betterment. Where no barriers\\r\\nhave been put against the emigration of the poor or the ambitious,\\r\\nunless special causes have arisen to create discontent with one\\'s\\r\\ncondition, the extent to which European countries have contributed\\r\\nto our immigrant population may be measured fairly closely by the\\r\\neconomic conditions at home. As far as the Northern countries are\\r\\nconcerned I would class all these causes under two heads: the first\\r\\nwill comprise all those conditions, natural and artificial, that can be\\r\\nsummarized under the term economic; the second will include a number of\\r\\nspecial circumstances or motives which may vary somewhat for the three\\r\\ncountries, indeed often for the locality and the individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst then we may consider the causes which arise from economic\\r\\nconditions. These are well illustrated by the Scandinavian countries,\\r\\nslightly modified in each case by the operation of the special causes.\\r\\nNorway is a land of mountains, these making up in the fact fifty-nine\\r\\nper cent of its total area, while forty-four per cent of the soil of\\r\\nSweden is unproductive. The winters are long and severe, the cold\\r\\nweather frequently sets in too early for the crops to ripen; with crop\\r\\nfailure comes lack of work for the laboring classes, and, burdened\\r\\nby heavy taxation, as was the Norwegian farmer only too often in the\\r\\nmiddle of the last century, debt and impoverishment for the holders\\r\\nof the numerous encumbered smaller estates. In Norway, especially,\\r\\nthe rewards of labor are meagre and the opportunities for material\\r\\nbetterment small.[37] \"Hard times\" and the inability of the country\\r\\nto support the rapidly increasing population has, then, been a most\\r\\npotent factor.[38] The same will hold true of Sweden, though in a\\r\\nsomewhat less degree. Denmark is better able to support a population\\r\\nof one hundred and forty-eight to the square mile than Sweden one of\\r\\ntwenty-eight or Norway one of eighteen.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [37] A great change for the better has been taking place during the\\r\\n       last few years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [38] Thus the failure of crops and the famine in Northern Sweden,\\r\\n       Finland, and Norway in 1902 was followed by a vastly increased\\r\\n       immigration from these sections. See above page 28. Compare\\r\\n       Table II, Appendix.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [39] The area and population of the three countries are:--Sweden,\\r\\n       area 172,876 sq. m., population in 1901, 5,175,228; Norway,\\r\\n       area 124,129, population in 1900, 2,239,880; Denmark, area\\r\\n       15,360, population in 1901, 2,447,441.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection compare above the statistics of immigration from\\r\\nthe three countries, which are much lower for Denmark than for Norway\\r\\nand Sweden. The Danes at home are a contented people, and it is\\r\\nnoticeable also that it is they who are most conservative here, who\\r\\nfoster the closest relation with the old home, and who consequently\\r\\nbecome Americanized last. The Norwegians are the most discontented, are\\r\\nreadiest for a change, are quickest to try the new; and it is they who\\r\\nmost readily break the bonds that bind them to their native country,\\r\\nwho most quickly adapt themselves to the conditions here, and who most\\r\\nrapidly become Americanized.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor R. B. Anderson, in his book on the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration[40] puts religious persecution as the primary cause of\\r\\nemigration from Norway. I cannot possibly believe that even in the\\r\\nimmigration of the first half of the nineteenth century religious\\r\\npersecution was, except in a few cases, the primary or even a very\\r\\nimportant cause in the Scandinavian countries. In conversation with and\\r\\nin numerous letters from pioneers and their descendants, especially\\r\\nin Iowa and Wisconsin, I have found that the hope of larger returns\\r\\nfor one\\'s labor is everywhere given as the main motive, sometimes as\\r\\nthe only one. Whether it be the pioneers of La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nin the thirties, those of Rock or Dane counties, Wisconsin, in the\\r\\nforties, or the Norwegian settlers of Clayton and Winneshiek counties,\\r\\nIowa, in the late forties and the fifties; the causes are everywhere\\r\\nprincipally economic. But letters written by pioneers and by those\\r\\nabout to emigrate testify amply to the fact that it was the hard times\\r\\nthat was the chief cause. And the same applies almost as generally to\\r\\nthe Swedes; among the Danes the economic factor has not operated so\\r\\nextensively, though here, also, it was the preponderating cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [40] _First Chapter, etc._\\r\\n\\r\\nA Norwegian journal, _Billed-Magazin_, published in Chicago in 1869-70\\r\\nand edited by Professor Svein Nilsen, offers much that throws light\\r\\non this question. It contains brief accounts of the early Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration and the earliest settlements, a regular column of news\\r\\nfrom the Scandinavian countries, interviews with pioneers, etc. In one\\r\\ninterview, Ole Nattestad, who sailed in 1837 from Vægli, Numedal, and\\r\\nbecame the founder of the fourth Norwegian settlement in America, that\\r\\nof Jefferson Prairie in Rock County, Wisconsin, and the neighboring\\r\\nBoone County in Illinois, describes his experience as a farmer in\\r\\nNumedal and how the difficulty of making any headway finally drove him\\r\\nto emigrate to America.[41] The statement of another pioneer I quote\\r\\nin its entirety.[42] It is that of John Nelson Luraas, who came from\\r\\nTin in Telemarken, to Muskego, Wisconsin, in 1839, and in 1843 moved to\\r\\nDane County, Wisconsin. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I was my father\\'s oldest son, and consequently heir to the Luraas\\r\\n  farm. It was regarded as one of the best in that neighborhood,\\r\\n  but there was a $1,400 mortgage on it. I had worked for my father\\r\\n  until I was twenty-five years old, and had had no opportunity of\\r\\n  getting money. It was plain to me that I would have a hard time of\\r\\n  it, if I should take the farm with the debt resting on it, pay a\\r\\n  reasonable amount to my brothers and sisters, and assume the care\\r\\n  of my aged father. I saw to my horror how one farm after the other\\r\\n  fell into the hands of the lendsman and other money-lenders, and\\r\\n  this increased my dread of attempting farming. But I got married\\r\\n  and had to do something. Then it occurred to me that the best thing\\r\\n  might be to emigrate to America. I was encouraged in this purpose\\r\\n  by letters written by Norwegian settlers in Illinois who had lived\\r\\n  two years in America. Such were the causes that led me to emigrate\\r\\n  and I presume the rest of our company were actuated by similar\\r\\n  motives.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [41] _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pp. 82-83.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [42] _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pp. 6-7.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [43] In 1868, Mr. Luraas moved to Webster County, Iowa, returning\\r\\n       to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1873. I knew him in the early\\r\\n       nineties as a well-to-do retired farmer living in Stoughton,\\r\\n       Wisconsin. He died in 1894.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter written by Andreas Sandsberg at Hellen, Norway, September\\r\\ntwelfth, 1831, to Gudmund Sandsberg in Kendall, New York, the former\\r\\ncomplains of the hard times in Norway. In the spring of 1836 the second\\r\\nparty of emigrants from Stavanger County came to America. On the 14th\\r\\nof May of that year Andreas Sandsberg wrote his brother Gudmund in\\r\\nAmerica as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  A considerable number of people are now getting ready to go to\\r\\n  America from this Amt. Two brigs are to depart from Stavanger in\\r\\n  about eight days from now, and will carry these people to America,\\r\\n  and if good reports come from them, the number of emigrants will\\r\\n  doubtless be still larger next year. A pressing and general lack\\r\\n  of money entering into every branch of industry, stops or at least\\r\\n  hampers business and makes it difficult for many people to earn the\\r\\n  necessaries of life. While this is the case on this side of the\\r\\n  Atlantic there is hope for abundance on the other, and this I take\\r\\n  it, is the chief cause of this growing disposition to emigrate.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [44] Letter copied from the original by R. B. Anderson in 1896 and\\r\\n       printed in _First Chapter_, pp. 135-136.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Olson Menes, who came to America in 1845, is cited in\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_, 1870, page 130, as follows, illustrating the\\r\\nprominence of the economic cause nine years later:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The emigrants of the preceding year (1844) ... wrote home ... and\\r\\n  told of the fertility of the soil, the cheap prices of land and of\\r\\n  good wages. In a letter which I received from Iver Hove, he writes\\r\\n  that there they raise thirty-five bushels of wheat per acre, and\\r\\n  the grass is so thick that one can easily cut enough in one day for\\r\\n  winter feed for the cow. Such things fell to our liking, and many\\r\\n  looked forward with eager longing to the distant West, which was\\r\\n  pictured as the Eden that loving Providence had destined as a home\\r\\n  for the workingman of Norway, so oppressed with cares and want.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those here cited, Nattestad was from Numedal, Luraas from\\r\\nTelemarken, Menes from Sogn, while Sandsberg came from Ryfylke. But\\r\\nthe conditions were the same also in other provinces. In 1844, Hans\\r\\nC. Tollefsrude and wife emigrated from Land. Of the cause of his\\r\\nemigrating and that of early emigration from Land in general, his son\\r\\nChristian H. Tollefsrude of Rolfe, Iowa, writes me:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The causes were, no personal means and no prospect even securing a\\r\\n  home in their native district, Torpen, Nordre Land (letter of July\\r\\n  27, 1904).\\r\\n\\r\\nRev. Abraham Jacobson of Decorah, Iowa, a pioneer himself, writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Reasons for emigrating were mostly economic, very few if any\\r\\n  religious.... Wages here were at the very least double that in\\r\\n  Norway, and generally much more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the emigration from Ringsaker, I may cite Simon Simerson of Belmond,\\r\\nIowa:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The causes were economic. In the case of my parents, they came\\r\\n  here to create the home that they saw no chance of securing in the\\r\\n  mother country. (Letter of Oct. 12, 1904.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar evidence might be adduced for other districts and for all the\\r\\nolder settlements throughout the Northwest. At a meeting held at the\\r\\nhome of Ole O. Flom in Stoughton, Wisconsin, on July twenty-eighth,\\r\\n1908, when the present writer read a paper on \"Early Norwegian\\r\\nImmigration,\" testimony to the same effect was given by old pioneers\\r\\nthere present. There is no need of further multiplying the evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA highly developed spirit of independence has always been a dominant\\r\\nelement in the Scandinavian character,--I have reference here\\r\\nparticularly to his desire for personal independence, that is,\\r\\nindependence in his condition in life. Nothing is so repugnant to him\\r\\nas indebtedness to others and dependence on others. An able-bodied\\r\\nScandinavian who was a burden to his fellows was well-nigh unheard\\r\\nof. By the right of primogeniture the paternal estate would go to the\\r\\noldest son. The families being frequently large, the owning of a home\\r\\nwas to a great many practically an impossibility under wage conditions\\r\\nas they were in the North in the first half and more of the preceding\\r\\ncentury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the Scandinavian farmer\\'s son, with his love of personal\\r\\nindependence and his strong inherent desire to own a home, finding\\r\\nhimself so circumstanced in his native country that there was little\\r\\nhope of his being able to realize this ambition except in the distant\\r\\nuncertain future, listens, with a willing ear to descriptions of\\r\\nAmerica, with its quick returns and its great opportunities. And so\\r\\nhe decides to emigrate. And this he is free to do for the government\\r\\nputs no barrier upon his emigrating. This trait has impelled many a\\r\\nScandinavian to come and settle in America; and it is a trait that is\\r\\nthe surest guarantee of the character of his citizenship. Here, too, a\\r\\nsocial factor merits mention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the nobility was abolished in Norway in 1814, the lines between\\r\\nthe upper and lower classes, the wealthy and the poor, were tightly\\r\\ndrawn and social classes were well defined. And while Norway is today\\r\\nthe most democratic country in Europe, and Sweden and Denmark are\\r\\nalso thoroughly liberal (in part through the influence of America and\\r\\nAmerican-Scandinavians), a titled aristocracy still exists in these\\r\\ncountries. The extreme deference to those in superior station or\\r\\nposition that custom and existing conditions enforced upon those in\\r\\nhumbler condition was repugnant to them. Not infrequently have pioneers\\r\\ngiven this as one cause for emigrating in connection with that of\\r\\neconomic advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Causes of Emigration Continued. Special Factors.\\r\\n                Religion as a Cause. Emigration Agents._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the class of special causes which have influenced the Scandinavian\\r\\nemigration, political oppression has operated only in the case of the\\r\\nDanes in Southern Jutland.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [45] As a result of the Dano-Prussian war of 1864 Jutland below\\r\\n       Skodborghus became a province of Prussia. The greatly\\r\\n       increased taxes that immediately followed and the restrictions\\r\\n       imposed by the Prussian government upon the use of the\\r\\n       Danish language, as well as other oppressive measures that\\r\\n       formed a part of the general plan of the Prussianizing of\\r\\n       Sleswick-Holstein, drove large numbers of Danes away from\\r\\n       their homes, and most of these came to the United States. In\\r\\n       notes and correspondence from Denmark in Scandinavian-American\\r\\n       papers during these years complaints regarding such\\r\\n       regulations constantly appear, and figures of emigration of\\r\\n       Danes \"who did not wish to be Prussians\" are unusually large\\r\\n       for this period; for example in the foreign column of the\\r\\n       _Billed-Magazin_. The United States statistics also show a\\r\\n       sudden increase in the Danish immigration during the sixties\\r\\n       and the early seventies. From 1850-1861 not more than 3,983\\r\\n       had emigrated from Denmark; while in the thirteen years from\\r\\n       1862 to 1874 the number reached 30,978.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary service, which elsewhere has often played such an important\\r\\npart in promoting emigration, has, in the Scandinavian countries, been\\r\\nonly a minor factor, the period of service required being very short.\\r\\nNevertheless it has in not a few cases been a secondary cause for\\r\\nemigrating. Those with whom I have spoken who have given this as their\\r\\nmotive have, however, been mostly Norwegians and Swedes; but none of\\r\\nthose who belong to the earlier period of emigration give their desire\\r\\nto escape military service as a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious persecution has played a part in some cases, especially in\\r\\nNorway and Sweden. The state church is the Lutheran, but every sect\\r\\nhas been tolerated since the middle of the century, in Norway since\\r\\n1845. While few countries have been freer from the evil of active\\r\\npersecution because of religious belief, intolerance and religious\\r\\nnarrowness have not been wanting. In the beginning of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, the followers of the lay preacher, Hans Nielsen Hauge, in\\r\\nNorway were everywhere persecuted. Hauge himself was imprisoned in\\r\\nChristiania for eight years. And the Jansenists in Helsingland, Sweden,\\r\\nwere in the forties subjected to similar persecution. Thus Eric\\r\\nJansen was arrested several times for conducting religious meetings\\r\\nbetween 1842-1846,--though it must in fairness be admitted that his\\r\\nfirst arrest was undoubtedly provoked by the extreme procedure of the\\r\\ndissenters themselves. After having been put in prison repeatedly,\\r\\nJansen embarked for America in 1846 and became the founder of the\\r\\ncommunistic colony of followers at Bishopshille,[46] Henry County,\\r\\nIllinois. No such organized emigration took place among the Haugians,\\r\\nbut we have no means of knowing to what extent individual emigration of\\r\\nthe followers of Hauge took place during the three decades immediately\\r\\nafter his death. The well-known Elling Eielson, a lay preacher and\\r\\nan ardent Haugian, emigrated in 1839 to Fox River, La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, and many of those who believed in the methods of Hauge and\\r\\nEielson came to America in the following years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [46] So named from _Biskopskulla_, Jansen\\'s native place in Sweden.\\r\\n       See article by Major John Swainson on \"The Swedish Colony at\\r\\n       Bishopshill, Illinois,\" in Nelson\\'s _Scandinavians_, I, p.\\r\\n       142. This article gives an excellent account of the founding\\r\\n       of the Bishopshill settlement and Jansen\\'s connection with it.\\r\\n       See also _American Communities_ by Wm. Alfred Hinds, 1902, pp.\\r\\n       300-320.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was persecution also that drove many Scandinavian Moravians to\\r\\nAmerica in 1740 and 1747. Moravian societies had been formed in\\r\\nChristiania in 1737, in Copenhagen in 1739, in Stockholm in 1740, and\\r\\nin Bergen in 1740.[47] In 1735 German Moravians from Herrnhut, Saxony,\\r\\nestablished a colony at Savannah, Georgia.[47] In this colony there\\r\\nseem to have been some Danes and Norwegians. In 1740 a permanent colony\\r\\nwas located at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in 1747 one at Bethabara,\\r\\nNorth Carolina. Persecuted Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Moravians\\r\\ntook part in the founding of both these colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [47] _Decorah-Posten_, September 9, 1904, p. 5. See also above p. 37.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have seen, the first Norwegian settlement in America was\\r\\nestablished in Kendall, Orleans County, New York, in 1825. It has been\\r\\nclaimed that the \"sloopers\" were driven to emigrate by persecution at\\r\\nhome.[48] Another writer has shown that the only one of the Stavanger\\r\\nQuakers who suffered for his belief prior to 1826 was Elias Tastad,\\r\\nand he, it seems, did not emigrate.[49] The leader of the emigrants in\\r\\n_Restaurationen_, Lars Larson i Jeilane, had spent one year in London\\r\\nin the employ of the noted English Quaker, William Allen. In 1818,\\r\\nStephen Grellet, a French nobleman, who had become a Quaker in America,\\r\\nand William Allen preached in Stavanger.[49] The Quakers of Stavanger\\r\\nwere of the poorest of the people. It is highly probable, as another\\r\\nwriter states,[50] that Grellet, while there, suggested to them that\\r\\nthey emigrate to America where they could better their condition in\\r\\nmaterial things and at the same time practice their religion without\\r\\nviolating the laws of the country. The main motive was therefore\\r\\nprobably economic.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [48] R. B. Anderson is emphatic in this view. Pages 45-131 of his\\r\\n       _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_ are devoted to a\\r\\n       discussion of the sloop \"Restaurationen\" and the Quaker Colony\\r\\n       in Orleans County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [49] Nelson\\'s _History of Scandinavians_, 1901, p. 133.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [50] B. L. Wick, in _The Friends_, Philadelphia, 1894, according to\\r\\n       Nelson, p. 134. I have not been able to secure a copy of the\\r\\n       above article, therefore cannot here state the arguments, or\\r\\n       cite more fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is perfectly clear to me that not very many of the Orleans County\\r\\ncolonists were devout Quakers; for we soon find them wandering apart\\r\\ninto various other churches. Some returned to Lutheranism; those who\\r\\nwent west became mostly Methodists or Mormons; others did not join\\r\\nany church; while the descendants of those who remained are to-day\\r\\nMethodists. The Orleans County Quakers do not seem to have even erected\\r\\na meeting-house; and in Scandinavian settlements a church, however\\r\\nhumble, is, next to a home, the first thought.[51] Nevertheless the\\r\\nQuakers of Stavanger did suffer annoyances, and it must be remembered\\r\\nthat the leader of the expedition and the owner of the sloop was a\\r\\ndevout Quaker,[52] as were also at least two other leading members of\\r\\nthe party. Had it not been for these very men the party would probably\\r\\nnot have emigrated, at least not at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [51] The reader who knows Björnson\\'s _Synnöve Solbakken_ will\\r\\n       remember the author\\'s introduction of this feature in Chapter\\r\\n       II, the first two pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [52] Lars Larson settled in Rochester where he could attend a\\r\\n       Quaker church. The same is true of Ole Johnson, another of the\\r\\n       \"sloopers\" who later settled in Kendall but finally returned\\r\\n       to Rochester, where he died in 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much persecution of the early converts to the Baptist faith\\r\\nin Denmark between 1850-1860; and not a few of this sect emigrated. In\\r\\n1848 F. O. Nilson, one of the early leaders of the Baptist Church in\\r\\nSweden, was imprisoned and later banished from the country. He fled\\r\\nto Denmark, and in 1851 embarked for America. In the fifties Swedish\\r\\nBaptists in considerable numbers came to the United States because of\\r\\npersecution. There are, however, very few Norwegian Baptists, and I\\r\\nknow of no cases where persecution drove Baptists to leave Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nProselyting of some non-Lutheran churches in Scandinavia has been the\\r\\nmeans of bringing many Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes to this country.\\r\\nIn the fifties Mormon missionaries were especially active in Denmark\\r\\nand Norway. Their efforts did not seem to be attended by much success\\r\\nin Norway, though not a few converts were made among the Norwegians\\r\\nin the early settlements in Illinois and Iowa, as in the Fox River\\r\\nSettlement.[53] In Denmark, however, Mormon proselyting was more\\r\\nsuccessful than in Norway. All those who accepted Mormonism emigrated\\r\\nto America of course, and most of them to Utah. In the years 1851,\\r\\n1852, and 1853 there emigrated fourteen, three, and thirty-two Danes,\\r\\nrespectively, to this country. But in 1854 the number rose to 691, and\\r\\nin the following three years to 1,736. In 1850 there were in Utah two\\r\\nDanes; in 1870 there were 4,957. The first Norwegian to go to Utah\\r\\nprobably was Henrik E. Sebbe, who came to America in 1836, and went to\\r\\nUtah in 1848, where he became a Mormon.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [53] Some of the early Mormon leaders were Norwegians, however,\\r\\n       as Bishop Canute Peterson (Marsett), of Ephraim, Utah, who\\r\\n       came to America in 1837 from Hardanger, Norway. The slooper\\r\\n       Gudmund Haugaas became an elder in the church of the Latter\\r\\n       Day Saints in La Salle County, Illinois; he died in 1849 and\\r\\n       was succeeded by his son Thomas Haugaas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849 a Norwegian-American, O. P. Peterson, first introduced\\r\\nMethodism in Norway.[54] After 1855 a regular Methodist mission was\\r\\nestablished in Scandinavia under the supervision of a Danish-American,\\r\\nC. B. Willerup.[55] While the Methodist church has not prospered in\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries, especially in Denmark and Norway, there are\\r\\nlarge numbers of Methodists among the Scandinavian immigrants in this\\r\\ncountry,[56] and the early congregations were recruited for a large\\r\\npart from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [54] See a brief account by Rev. N. M. Liljegren in Nelson\\'s\\r\\n       _History of Scandinavians_, I, pp. 205-209.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [55] Methodism had been introduced into Sweden from England early\\r\\n       in the century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe efforts of steamship companies and emigration agents have been a\\r\\npowerful factor in promoting Scandinavian emigration. Through them\\r\\nliterature advertising in glowing terms the advantages of the New\\r\\nWorld was scattered far and wide in Scandinavia. Such literature often\\r\\ndealt with the prosperity of Scandinavians who had previously settled\\r\\nin America. Letters from successful settlers were often printed and\\r\\ndistributed broadcast. The early immigrants from the North settled\\r\\nlargely in Illinois, Wisconsin, and, a little later, in Iowa. As\\r\\nclearers of the forest and tillers of the soil they contributed their\\r\\nlarge share to the development of the country. None could better endure\\r\\nthe hardships of pioneer life on the western frontier. Knowing this,\\r\\nmany western states began to advertise their respective advantages in\\r\\nthe Scandinavian countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [56] By far the larger number, however, are Swedes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Causes of Emigration continued. The Influence of\\r\\n                Successful Pioneers. \"America-letters.\"\\r\\n                   The Spirit of Adventure. Summary._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFar more influential, however, than the factors just noted were the\\r\\nefforts put forth by successful immigrants to induce their relatives\\r\\nand friends to follow them. Numerous letters were written home praising\\r\\nAmerican laws and institutions, and setting forth the opportunities\\r\\nhere offered. These letters were read and passed around to friends.\\r\\nMany who had relatives in America would travel long distances to\\r\\nhear what the last \"America-letter\" had to report. Among the early\\r\\nimmigrants who did much in this way to promote emigration from their\\r\\nnative districts was one whom we have already spoken of, Gjert\\r\\nHovland. He wrote many letters home praising American institutions.\\r\\nThese letters \"were transcribed and the copies distributed far and\\r\\nwide in the Province of Bergen; and a large number were thus led to\\r\\nemigrate.\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [57] See _Billed-Magazin_, p. 74.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interviews in _Billed-Magazin_ contain statements from several\\r\\namong the early settlers on Koshkonong Prairie and the neighborhood\\r\\nof Stoughton which give evidence of the part that \"America-letters\"\\r\\nplayed in their emigration. On page 123 occurs a statement of Gaute\\r\\nIngbrigtson (Gulliksrud) who came from Tin in Telemarken in 1843 and\\r\\nbecame one of the earliest pioneers of Dunkirk Township in Dane County.\\r\\nHe says: \"Two of my uncles and a brother emigrated in 1839. I, however,\\r\\nremained at home with my father who was a farmer in the Parish of Tin.\\r\\nBut then letters came with good news from America, and my relatives as\\r\\nwell as other acquaintances on this side of the ocean were encouraged\\r\\nto emigrate. From this it came about that I and many others in my\\r\\nnative district prepared for leaving in the spring of 1843. The party\\r\\nnumbered about one hundred and twenty....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already had occasion to refer to a letter received by Ole\\r\\nMenes of Stoughton in 1845. Ingbrigt Helle came from Kragerö in\\r\\n1845 and settled in the Town of Dunn. The ship he came on brought\\r\\none hundred and forty immigrants and he mentions the fact that\\r\\nmany had been induced to emigrate by letters from America, and he\\r\\nwrites: \"Such letters from America urging emigration was, as far as\\r\\nI can see, the thing that brought the majority of emigrants to bid\\r\\nfarewell to Norway.\" Ole Knudson Dyrland, who emigrated from Siljord,\\r\\nTelemarken, in 1843, and became one of the earliest white settlers in\\r\\nDunn Township, Dane County, testifying to the same fact, mentions Ole\\r\\nKnudson Trovatten as one who, through letters, exerted considerable\\r\\ninfluence upon emigration in Telemarken (page 218, _Billed-Magazin_,\\r\\n1870). We shall meet Trovatten again below as a pioneer in the Town\\r\\nof Cottage Grove in the same county. The editor of _Billed-Magazin_\\r\\nwrites of Trovatten elsewhere, page 283, after giving a brief sketch of\\r\\nhis life: \"he settled on Koshkonong and wrote therefrom many letters\\r\\nto his numerous friends in his native country in which he, with\\r\\nmuch eloquence, made his countrymen acquainted with the glories of\\r\\nAmerica, and there is no doubt that Trovatten in a large measure gave\\r\\nthe impulse to the rapid development of emigration in the region of\\r\\nTelemarken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Trovatten\\'s influence as a promoter of immigration Gunder T. Mandt,\\r\\nhimself an immigrant of 1843 (died 1907, Stoughton, Wisconsin), gives\\r\\nsimilar testimony. He speaks of the opposition to emigration in Upper\\r\\nTelemarken, which found expression in all sorts of adverse accounts\\r\\nof America, especially among the clergy, and that much uncertainty\\r\\nprevailed among the masses as to the advisability of going to America.\\r\\nDuring all this, Trovatten, he says, \"came to be looked upon as an\\r\\nangel of peace, who had gone beforehand to the New World, whence he\\r\\nsent back home to his countrymen, so burdened by economic sorrows,\\r\\nthe olive-branch of promise, with assurances of a happier life in\\r\\nAmerica.... \\'Ole Trovatten has said so,\\' became the refrain in all\\r\\naccounts of the land of wonder, and in a few years he was the most\\r\\ntalked of man in Upper Telemarken. His letters from America gave a\\r\\npowerful impulse to emigration, and it is probable that hundreds of\\r\\nthose who now are plowing the soil of Wisconsin and Minnesota would\\r\\nstill be living in their ancestors\\' domains in the land of Harald\\r\\nFairhair, if they had not been induced to bid old Norway farewell\\r\\nthrough Trovatten\\'s glittering accounts of conditions on this side of\\r\\nthe ocean.\" (_Billed-Magazin_, 1870, p. 38.) Similar evidence of the\\r\\ninfluence of \"America-letters\" is also given by Knud Aslakson Juve, a\\r\\npioneer of 1844, in the Town of Pleasant Spring, in Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the preceding chapter I spoke of Gjert Hovland\\'s\\r\\nletters in 1835 as a chief factor in bringing about the emigration of\\r\\n1836. From settlers in other portions of the country comes testimony\\r\\nof similar nature, and I have spoken with many pioneers from a later\\r\\nperiod of immigration, whose coming was, in the last instance,\\r\\ndetermined by favorite accounts of America received from friends and\\r\\nrelatives already resident there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn letters from immigrants to their relatives at home prepaid tickets,\\r\\nor the price of the ticket, were often enclosed. This custom was so\\r\\ncommon as to become a special factor in emigration. According to\\r\\n_Norsk Folkeblad_ (cited in _Billed-Magazin_, p. 134), 4,000 Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants, via Christiana in 1868, took with them $40,335 (Speciedaler)\\r\\nin cash money of which $21,768 (Spd.) had been sent by relatives in\\r\\nAmerica to cover the expense of the journey. It has been estimated that\\r\\nabout fifty per cent of Scandinavian emigrants, arrive by prepaid\\r\\npassage tickets secured by relatives in this country.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [58] Nelson\\'s _History of Scandinavians_, page 56.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visits of successful Scandinavians back home was in the early days\\r\\nan important factor; and as a rule only those who had been prosperous\\r\\nwould return. In 1835 Knud Anderson Slogvig, who had emigrated in the\\r\\nsloop as we know, returned to Norway and became the chief promoter of\\r\\nthe exodus from the Province of Stavanger in 1836, which resulted in\\r\\nthe settlement at Fox River, La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already above, page 63, recited this fact and its significance\\r\\ntoward promoting further emigration from Stavanger Province and of\\r\\ninaugurating the first exodus from Hardanger also. Thus, while Jacob\\r\\nSlogvig, the brother, was one of a few to secure land in La Salle\\r\\nCounty and make the beginnings of settlement, Knud became the means\\r\\nof bringing hosts of immigrants from Norway to recruit the colony and\\r\\nstart it upon its course of growth. In precisely a similar way did two\\r\\nother brothers become even more significant factors in the foundation\\r\\nand development of the earliest Norwegian settlement in Wisconsin,\\r\\nnamely, that of Jefferson Prairie in Rock County. They were Ole and\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad, who had emigrated in 1837. Returning to Norway in\\r\\n1839 Ansten Nattestad became the father of emigration from Numedal,\\r\\nNorway, bringing with him a large party of immigrants, who located for\\r\\nthe most part in southern Rock County, Wisconsin, and adjacent parts of\\r\\nthe state of Illinois. But of this movement I shall have occasion to\\r\\nspeak more fully below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn equally interesting instance we have from a somewhat later period.\\r\\nWe have above referred to Ole Dyrland\\'s testimony of the effect of Ole\\r\\nTrovatten\\'s letters. After remarking that many still were doubtful of\\r\\nthe advisability of emigrating he goes on to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"But then Knud Svalestuen of Vinje, who had lived for a time in the\\r\\n  Muskego Settlement, came home on a trip back to Norway, and by his\\r\\n  accounts even the most hesitating were made firm in their faith.\\r\\n  Knud came in the fall of 1843, and during the winter he received\\r\\n  visits of men sent out from various districts in Telemarken, who\\r\\n  came to secure reliable information about the new country. The\\r\\n  next spring hosts of intending emigrants left the upper mountain\\r\\n  districts of the country.... Three emigrant ships left that year\\r\\n  from Porsgrund. On board the ship I left in there were two hundred\\r\\n  and eleven emigrants.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editor of _Billed-Magazin_ gives other interviews with pioneers\\r\\nshowing the effect of Svalestuen\\'s return (page 293).\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Norwegian pioneers wrote books regarding the settlements\\r\\nand American conditions, and these, laudatory as they were, exerted\\r\\nnot a little influence. Special mention should be made of Ole Rynning,\\r\\nwhose pamphlet, _Sandfaerdig Beretning om Amerika til Veiledning og\\r\\nHjaelp for Bonde og, Menigmand, skrevet of en Norsk som kom der i\\r\\nJuni Maaned_, 1837.[59] This little book of thirty-nine pages had\\r\\nnot a little to do with the emigration that followed to La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois, and elsewhere. In it the author gives an intelligent\\r\\ndiscussion of thirteen questions regarding America which he set himself\\r\\nto answer. Among them were: What is the nature of the country? What is\\r\\nthe reason that so many people go there? Is it not to be feared that\\r\\nthe land will soon be overpopulated? In what parts are the Norwegian\\r\\nsettlements? Which is the most convenient and the cheapest route to\\r\\nthem? What is the price of land? What provision is there for the\\r\\neducation of children? What language is spoken and is it difficult\\r\\nto learn? Is there danger of disease in America? What kind of people\\r\\nshould emigrate?\\r\\n\\r\\n  [59] _True Account of America for the Information and Help of\\r\\n       Peasant and Commoner_, written by a Norwegian who came there\\r\\n       in the month of June, 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother writer of immigration literature whose writings were widely\\r\\ndistributed and had considerable influence was Johan Reinert Reierson.\\r\\nHe came to America in 1843, but returned to Norway soon after. In\\r\\nAmerica he had written a book, _Veiviseren_,[60] which he published\\r\\nin Norway and was read far and wide. This book contains a fund of\\r\\ninformation regarding the different settlements, as Racine County,\\r\\nWisconsin, La Salle County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa, and others,\\r\\nall of which Reierson had himself visited. Reierson became the founder\\r\\nof the first Norwegian settlement in Texas in 1847-48.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [60] _The Pathfinder_, a book of one hundred and sixty-six pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the events leading up to this, _Billed-Magazin_ for 1870 gives a\\r\\ncircumstantial account, pages 58-60, 66-67, and 75-76. Reierson\\'s\\r\\nbook seems to have been a leading factor in promoting emigration from\\r\\nValders. Among the earliest to leave this region were Nils Hanson\\r\\nFjeld and family of South Aurdal, Valders, who emigrated in 1847. He\\r\\nsays, page 236 of _Billed-Magazin_ for 1870, that before him only\\r\\ntwo or three single men had gone to America from that region. The\\r\\n\"America-fever\" had not yet taken hold of the people, \"many would not\\r\\ngive credence to mere hearsay, but after a while a couple copies of\\r\\nReierson\\'s book about Texas came to the district. \\'Now we have the\\r\\nprinted word to go by,\\' it was said, and many of the doubters soon were\\r\\nconverted to the orthodox faith in the land of promise beyond the great\\r\\nocean.\" And as a result, many began to emigrate. As early as 1848,\\r\\nemigration from Valders on a considerable scale was already in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall here also mention Ansten Nattestad, who wrote a similar book,\\r\\nwhich he took with him on his return to Norway in 1838, and had printed\\r\\nthere; this became a factor operating toward emigration, especially\\r\\nin Numedal. Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson\\'s _Reise blandt de norske\\r\\nEmigranter i de forenede nordamerikanske Fristater_, Stavanger, 1846\\r\\n(124 pages), gave much valuable information about the settlements, but\\r\\nwas not calculated to exert much influence toward emigration. The first\\r\\nthree that I have mentioned, however, had an influence which we today\\r\\ncan hardly fully appreciate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, curiosity and the spirit of adventure have doubtless prompted\\r\\nsome to cross the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, the chief influences that have promoted Scandinavian\\r\\nemigration to the United States in the nineteenth century have been\\r\\nin the order of their importance: first, the prospect of material\\r\\nbetterment and the love of a freer and more independent life; second,\\r\\nletters of relatives and friends who had emigrated to the United\\r\\nStates and visits of these again to their native country; third, the\\r\\nadvertising of agents of emigration; fourth, religious persecution at\\r\\nhome; fifth, church proselytism; sixth, political oppression; seventh,\\r\\nmilitary service; and eighth, the desire for adventure. Fugitives from\\r\\njustice have been few, and paupers and criminals in the Scandinavian\\r\\ncountries are not sent out of the country; they are taken care of by\\r\\nthe government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Growth of the Fox River Settlement. The Immigration\\r\\n                  of 1836. Further Personal Sketches._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page fifty-five above I spoke of the advance troop of six men who\\r\\nestablished the Fox River Settlement in 1834. A list of those who\\r\\nfollowed from New York in 1835 was also given. Other settlers came\\r\\nin subsequent years, more and more now coming directly from Norway\\r\\nto La Salle County. The vicinity of the present towns of Norway and\\r\\nLeland, in eastern and northern La Salle County, became centers of\\r\\na settlement, which later extended east into Kendall County (Newark\\r\\nand Lisbon) and into Grundy County toward Morris, as also north into\\r\\nDeKalb County (Rollo, Sandwich), and northwest clear into southwestern\\r\\nLee County (Paw Paw, Sublette, and surrounding region). The slooper,\\r\\nOle Olson Hetletvedt, had not come west with the first party. He lived\\r\\nfirst in Kendall and then went to Niagara Falls, being there employed\\r\\nin a paper mill. Here he married a Miss Chamberlain, then moved back to\\r\\nOrleans County. In 1839 he and his wife went west, settling in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. He bought land on the spot where the town of Newark now stands.\\r\\nHe became well known as a lay preacher of the Haugian faith in the Fox\\r\\nRiver Settlement, also visiting the settlements founded soon after in\\r\\nWisconsin and in Lee County, Iowa. He died in Kendall County in 1849 or\\r\\n1850.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [61] One of his sons was Colonel Porter C. Olson of Civil War fame,\\r\\n       member of the Thirty-sixth Illinois Infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIver Waller, who bought a claim of Miss Pearson in 1835, came\\r\\ndirectly from Norway to La Salle County that year. Baldwin\\'s _History\\r\\nof La Salle County_ lists Ove Stenson Rossadal and wife, and John\\r\\nStenson Rossadal among the arrivals of 1835, and as being brothers\\r\\nof Daniel Rossadal, of whom we have spoken above. Strand\\'s _History\\r\\nof the Norwegians in Illinois_ correctly names them as sons of\\r\\nDaniel Rossadal. Nils Bilden, who also came during this period (year\\r\\nuncertain), was therefore one of the very first emigrants from\\r\\nHardanger to the United States. He settled at Rochester, Sangamon\\r\\nCounty, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the extent of Norwegian immigration during the years immediately\\r\\npreceding the year, 1836, which inaugurates a new period in the\\r\\nmovement, our information is very fragmentary. American statistics give\\r\\nforty-two and thirty-one, respectively, for 1834 and 1835, as the total\\r\\nimmigration from Norway and Sweden. In 1833 there were sixteen, while\\r\\nthe number for 1832 is three hundred and thirteen.[62] The total number\\r\\nbetween 1826 and 1831 is given as sixty-eight. It is probable, however,\\r\\nthat these figures do not represent the full number of immigrants\\r\\nduring these years. Norwegian government statistics on immigration\\r\\nwhich are available since 1836, give the number of immigrants for that\\r\\nyear as two hundred, which is also the figure for the following year.\\r\\nIt is to this exodus that we shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [62] Among those who came in 1832 was John Nordboe from\\r\\n       Gudbrandsdalen, Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have above, under Causes of Emigration, had occasion to speak of\\r\\nKnud Slogvig\\'s return to Norway in 1835, after a ten years\\' residence\\r\\nin America;[63] the results of his return were also there briefly\\r\\nnoted. In the two ships, _Norden_ and _Den Norske Klippe_,[64] which\\r\\nsailed from Stavanger in July of 1836, came two hundred immigrants,[65]\\r\\nwho located for the most part in the Fox River Settlement. These\\r\\nstopped en route for a short time in Rochester, no doubt gathering\\r\\nadvice and information from Lars Larson, the captain of the sloopers,\\r\\nresident there as we know; thence they continued their journey west\\r\\nto Chicago and to La Salle County. Thus the nucleus which had been\\r\\nformed in 1834-35 in a very short time developed into a considerable\\r\\nsettlement at a time when the surrounding country was practically a\\r\\nwilderness. The immigrants of 1836 were, in part, from Stavanger, some,\\r\\nhowever, were from other districts, east and north, as especially\\r\\nHardanger and Voss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [63] While in Norway he married a sister of Ole Olson Hetletvedt,\\r\\n       which may have been in part the purpose of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [64] _The North_ and _The Norwegian Rock_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [65] Langeland says a hundred and sixty on page eighteen of his\\r\\n       work, elsewhere a hundred and fifty. Two hundred seems,\\r\\n       however, to have been approximately the number.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all who came settled in Mission and the later Miller townships,\\r\\nhowever. Some went considerably farther north and established, in Adams\\r\\nTownship, a northern extension of the original settlement at and around\\r\\nthe present village of Leland. The two, however, later grew together\\r\\ninto one large settlement, extending also, east into Kendall County.\\r\\nThe first white settler in Adams Township was Mordicai Disney, who\\r\\nlocated there in 1836, slightly prior to the coming of the immigrants\\r\\nfrom Stavanger.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [66] Disney left again in 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of our immigrants to locate in Adams Township where Halvor\\r\\nNelson and Ole T. Olson, who in the spring of 1837, settled on sections\\r\\ntwenty-one and twenty-two;[67] they had lived in Mission Township\\r\\nsince their coming in 1836. Among those who came in 1836 and located\\r\\nin Mission Township were: Amund Anderson Hornefjeld, who in 1840 went\\r\\nto Wisconsin (see below), Erick Johnson Savig[68] and wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nfrom Kvinherred Parish, Knud Olson Hetletvedt and wife, Serena (both of\\r\\nwhom died of cholera in 1849), Osmund Thomason,[69] wife and daughter,\\r\\nAnne, Henrik Erickson Sebbe and two sons, who went to Salt Lake City in\\r\\n1848 (see above, p. 78). Samuel Peerson and Helge Vatname also seem to\\r\\nhave come in 1836; they are recorded as living at Norway, Illinois,\\r\\nin 1837, and as aiding in bringing some of the immigrants of 1837 from\\r\\nChicago to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [67] The Olson homestead is still owned by the son, Nels Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [68] Died in 1840, leaving wife and two children, John and Anna\\r\\n       Bertha; the latter later became the wife of John J. Næset in\\r\\n       the town of Christiana, Dane County, Wisconsin. Sævig was born\\r\\n       in 1803, his wife in 1809.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [69] Died in 1876, ninety-two years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of those who came in 1836 did not go directly to La Salle County.\\r\\nAndrew Anderson (Aasen), wife, Olena, three sons and two daughters,\\r\\nfrom Tysvær Parish, Skjold, remained two years in Orleans County,\\r\\nNew York, coming to La Salle County in 1838; he died of the cholera\\r\\nin 1849. John Hidle from Stavanger County, Norway, also emigrated in\\r\\n1836, coming direct to La Salle County. In 1838 he settled at Lisbon,\\r\\nKendall County, being thus the first Norwegian to locate there and as\\r\\nfar as I have been able to find out, the first Norwegian to settle in\\r\\nthat county (for Ole O. Hetletvedt did not come till 1839). Hidle,\\r\\nwho wrote his name Hill in this country, married Susanna Anderson,\\r\\ndaughter of Andrew Anderson; she was fourteen years old when her\\r\\nparents came to America, and is still living, at Morris, Illinois, with\\r\\nher daughter Mrs. Austin Osmond. Lars Bö and Michael Bö, who lived\\r\\nand died in La Salle County, came when John Hill did. Lars Larson\\r\\nBrimsöe, born in Stavanger, 1812, worked for some time as a carpenter\\r\\nin New York and Chicago before settling in La Salle County. In 1858 he\\r\\nlocated in Benton County, Iowa, and in 1872 went to Adams County (died\\r\\n1873). Björn Anderson Kvelve and wife, Catherine,[70] and two sons,\\r\\nArnold Andrew and Brunn, from Vikedal, Ryfylke, lived for a year in\\r\\nRochester, New York, came in 1837 to Mission Township, La Salle County.\\r\\nHe removed to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1839. Of Lars Tallakson, who\\r\\ncame to America in 1836 (by way of Gothenburg), we shall speak below.\\r\\nHerman Aarag Osmond, born near Stavanger, 1818, also came to America in\\r\\n1836. He first lived in Ohio, came in 1837 to Chicago, then to Norway,\\r\\nLa Salle County. He settled on a farm near Norway in 1848, but bought\\r\\nin 1869 a farm near Newark, Kendall County; Herman Osmond died in\\r\\nNewark in 1888.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [70] Abel Catherine von Krogh was born in 1809. Her father was\\r\\n       Arnold von Krogh. Björne Anderson Kvelve was born in 1801. For\\r\\n       a sketch of Björn Anderson and his wife see pages 155-170 of\\r\\n       _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_ by R. B. Anderson,\\r\\n       who is their third son (b. 1846 in Albion, Wisconsin); I am\\r\\n       indebted to this work for many facts relative to the Illinois\\r\\n       pioneers of 1836-1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the immigrants of 1836 located in Chicago, which then consisted\\r\\nof only a few houses. Among these was first, Halstein Torison (or\\r\\nTörison), to whom Knud Langeland accords the distinction of being\\r\\nthe first Norwegian resident of Chicago. He was from Fjeldberg in\\r\\nSöndhordland, and he came to Chicago with wife and children in October,\\r\\n1836. The site of his home was that now occupied by the Chicago and\\r\\nNorthwestern Depot on Wells Street. He worked first as a gardener\\r\\nfor a Mr. Newberry. Reverend Dietrichson speaks of him, in 1844, as\\r\\nprosperous and as occupying a leading position among Chicago Norwegians\\r\\nat that time. In 1848 he moved to Calumet, twenty miles south of\\r\\nChicago, where he lived until his death in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvein Lothe, from Hardanger, also came in 1836, as did Nils Röthe and\\r\\nwife, Torbjör, who were from Voss. The latter remained, however, in\\r\\nRochester, New York, one year before coming to Chicago. Nils Röthe and\\r\\nwife were the first to emigrate from Voss, Norway. Johan Larson, from\\r\\nKopervik, an island not far north of Stavanger city, also located in\\r\\nChicago in 1836. He was a sailor and had, it seems, visited Chicago\\r\\nbefore; what year he came to America, I do not know. I may also mention\\r\\nBaard Johnson, who, with his wife and five children, settled in Chicago\\r\\nin 1837. Those we have mentioned form the nucleus out of which has\\r\\ngrown today the largest Norwegian city colony in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSvein Knutson Lothe, who emigrated with wife and two children from\\r\\nHardanger in 1836, was from the Parish of Ullensvang. There were\\r\\neleven persons in all who came from Ullensvang that year, the other\\r\\nseven being: Jon Jonson Aga, wife and two children, Torbjörn Djönne,\\r\\nOlav Öystenson Lofthus and Omund Helgeson Maakestad. Maakestad became\\r\\nthe founder of the Hardanger settlement in Lee County, Illinois (see\\r\\nbelow). I am not able to say where Aga, Djönne or Lofthus located.\\r\\nThere were also seven immigrants from Ulvik Parish, Hardanger, that\\r\\nyear; they were: Sjur Haaheim and wife, Paul Dale and wife, Sjur Dale\\r\\nand wife and Aslak Holven. These eighteen persons form the advance\\r\\nguard of the immigration from Hardanger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have spoken of the two ships that came from Stavanger in 1836.\\r\\nThese were followed in the next year by _Enigheden_ (Harmony), Captain\\r\\nJensen, carrying ninety-three passengers. These were for the most part\\r\\nfrom Tysvær and from Hjelmeland, and Aardal in Ryfylke, from the city\\r\\nof Stavanger, and from Egersund. They came to New York, thence went to\\r\\nAlbany and Rochester, and by way of the lakes to Chicago. Most of them\\r\\nwent to La Salle County, although not all settled there permanently.\\r\\nAmong the passengers were Hans Valder and wife from Ryfylke, Knud Olson\\r\\nEide, Ole Thompson Eide, from Fogn, near Stavanger, Thomas A. Thompson,\\r\\nChristopher Danielson and family, Östen Espeland and family, and Knud\\r\\nDanielson and family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailing of _Enigheden_ may be regarded as a continuation of the\\r\\nmovement in Stavanger county, which was given such an impetus by Knud\\r\\nSlogvig\\'s return in 1835. Other immigrants continued to come from this\\r\\nregion in subsequent years, but the autumn of 1837 inaugurates a change\\r\\nin the course of the movement to a more northerly region, Hardanger,\\r\\nVoss, and Bergen, for a period, contributing a large share to the now\\r\\nrapidly increasing numbers of emigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n                 _The Year 1837. The Sailing of Aegir._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of Gjert Hovland in this new trend in the immigration\\r\\nshould be noted. South Bergenhus now became the scene of immigration\\r\\nactivity. At the same time it is to be observed that Hardanger had\\r\\ncontributed its quota of immigrants in the exodus of 1836. The return\\r\\nof Knud Slogvig was noised far beyond the County of Stavanger. Among\\r\\nthose who travelled long distances to see and talk with Slogvig and\\r\\nget personal affirmation of what reports had told of America, was Nils\\r\\nP. Langeland, a school teacher from Samnanger, one of the emigrants of\\r\\n1837. Similarly Knud Langeland relates in _Nordmaendene i Amerika_,\\r\\npage twenty-three, how he paid a visit to Slogvig in the winter of\\r\\n1836, and received from him assurance of what he had read[71] about\\r\\nthe New World. Knud Langeland gives a most interesting account of how\\r\\nhis interest in America became aroused; though a personal experience,\\r\\nit is undoubtedly typical of that of many a young man in Bergen and\\r\\nsurrounding region at this time. As a document in immigration history,\\r\\nit is sufficiently significant to warrant quoting in considerable part.\\r\\nHe says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Purely by accident I found in a friend\\'s library in Bergen a book\\r\\n  by a German entitled REISEN IN AMERIKA.... As this book contained\\r\\n  some vivid pictures of the distant regions the traveller had\\r\\n  visited, as well as of the impressions he had received of land and\\r\\n  people in the new world, it was read with all the allurements of a\\r\\n  novel. Here was given full information about the German emigration.\\r\\n  With this description of travels in my pocket I went early one\\r\\n  summer morning along the bay of Solem and up the steep ascent\\r\\n  of Lyderhorn. Up there I read and dreamed of the new wonderful\\r\\n  world far away to the west. The mist had sunk low over the fjords\\r\\n  between the isles about Bergen, but up there around the tree-tops\\r\\n  it was bright sunshine. It was the first time I had seen this\\r\\n  glorious sight peculiar to mountain regions. If any prosaic nature\\r\\n  ever received poetic inspiration and exaltation it was during\\r\\n  this time, while my eyes beheld the sunlit surface of the fog and\\r\\n  in the distance caught a glimpse of the sparkling shield of the\\r\\n  North Sea, which seemed to rise to the height of the mountain....\\r\\n  And far out toward the west, thousands of miles out there, lies\\r\\n  the land about which I am reading, lies the big, still so little\\r\\n  known part of the world, with its secrets and its wonders. From\\r\\n  that time I sought all books and descriptions of travel concerning\\r\\n  America which I could get, and, together with an uncle of mine, I\\r\\n  began to collect as much information about the new world, as well\\r\\n  through books as through the verbal accounts from Stavanger people,\\r\\n  which now began to be current in the district concerning Kleng\\r\\n  Peerson\\'s emigration and return, without our yet actually thinking\\r\\n  of emigrating. Through a kind friend\\'s help I was enabled in 1834\\r\\n  to spend six months in England, on which occasion I gathered a\\r\\n  number of pamphlets and books about America and emigration from\\r\\n  England. In this way more definite and more reliable information as\\r\\n  to conditions in America and the journey thither gradually spread\\r\\n  in the vicinity. This seemed to discredit the many ridiculous and\\r\\n  impossible stories now constantly set in circulation. Slowly but\\r\\n  steadily the thought of emigrating to America took root; more and\\r\\n  more joined the little group which now in earnest began talking\\r\\n  of selling their homes and going to America. Then it was that the\\r\\n  bishop of Bergen wrote a letter to the farmers of Bergen on the\\r\\n  text, \"Remain in the country; make your living honorably,\" whether\\r\\n  he forgot it or did not regard it suitable to the occasion, he\\r\\n  failed to quote the second commandment of the passage: \"Multiply\\r\\n  and fill the world.\" The latter the farmers had adhered to; most\\r\\n  of them had large families, and since the land at home was filled,\\r\\n  while they now heard that a large part of the new world was\\r\\n  unsettled, they decided to disobey the bishop\\'s advice and go to\\r\\n  the new Canaan, where flowed milk and honey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [71] Especially in a German book on travels in America, see his\\r\\n       account, p. 21. Knud Langeland did not emigrate, however,\\r\\n       before 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far Langeland\\'s account. While the evidence points to many causes as\\r\\noperating conjointly toward bringing about the departure, in the spring\\r\\nof 1837, of so many from Samnanger and from Voss, the influence of Nils\\r\\nP. Langeland, already mentioned above, seems to have been a special\\r\\nfactor at this particular time. Nils Langeland was already then an\\r\\nelderly man. He had devoted his life to the cause of popular education,\\r\\nbut the intolerant clergy of the time found him too liberal minded and\\r\\ncontinually put obstacles in his way. Although he was supported by a\\r\\ngroup of faithful friends, his usefulness was hampered; discouraged at\\r\\nlast, he decided to leave his native country and go to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was in the summer of 1836. In the fall of that year, Captain\\r\\nBehrens returned with the bark, _Aegir_, from America, whither he\\r\\nhad carried a cargo of freight in the summer. Langeland\\'s friends\\r\\nhad already sold their homes and were preparing to emigrate. Hearing\\r\\nof this, Behrens decided to convert his bark into a passenger boat,\\r\\nand he offered to take them to America the next spring; the offer\\r\\nwas accepted. While preparations were going on, the announcements of\\r\\nthe projected sailing, which had been printed in the newspapers, led\\r\\nintending immigrants from other sections, also, to join the party.\\r\\nAmong these was Ole Rynning, from Snaasen, in Trondhjem Province, of\\r\\nwhom we shall speak more at length below.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 4th of July, 1837, _Aegir_ sailed from Bergen with eighty-two\\r\\npassengers. Among these were Mons Aadland, Nils Fröland, Anders\\r\\nNordvig, Ingebrigt Brudvig, Thomas Bauge and Thorbjörn Veste, all of\\r\\nwhom had large families, and the following from Hardanger: Nils L.\\r\\nJördre, wife and six children, and Peder J. Maurset, wife and child,\\r\\nfrom Ulvik Parish, and Amund Rosseland, wife and three children, Lars\\r\\nG. Skeie, wife and two children, Sjur E. Rosseland and Svein L. Midthus\\r\\nfrom Vikör. The last-named were the first to emigrate from Vikör. The\\r\\nparty further included Halle Væte, wife and grown daughter, and the\\r\\nfollowing persons: Odd J. Himle, Kolbein O. Saue, Styrk O. Saue, Nils\\r\\nL. Bolstad, Baard Haugen, John H. Björgo, Ole Dyvik, all of whom were\\r\\nmarried, besides several single men, mostly relatives of the above,\\r\\nnamely: Dövig, Bauge, Fröland, Nordvig, Hisdal, Tösseland, et al. Each\\r\\nadult paid sixty dollars (Norwegian specie) for passage, children under\\r\\ntwelve paying half price. They arrived in New York eight weeks later.\\r\\nThe journey inland was attended by numerous expenses for which the\\r\\nimmigrants were not prepared. When they had gotten as far as Detroit,\\r\\nthe above-mentioned Nils P. Langeland found himself without the\\r\\nnecessary means to continue the journey. His friends who had offered to\\r\\npay his expenses as far as Chicago, at last became discouraged over the\\r\\nconstant demands upon their funds and Langeland was obliged to remain\\r\\nin Detroit. Here, being a capable carpenter, he soon found work; later\\r\\nhe removed to Lapeer County, Michigan, bought there 120 acres of land,\\r\\nplying at the same time the trade of a carpenter. Thus it came about\\r\\nthat Nils Langeland became the first Norwegian to settle in the State\\r\\nof Michigan, though we have seen that Kleng Peerson had visited the\\r\\nstate four years earlier. At least three others of the immigrants of\\r\\n1837 located temporarily in the State of Michigan that year, namely,\\r\\nIngebright Nordvig, Östen Espeland, who had come in _Enigheden_, and\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland. These went to Adrian, Lenawee County, but left again\\r\\nsoon after. We shall meet Bjaaland again in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nand on Koshkonong Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n                      _Beaver Creek. Ole Rynning._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigrants who came in the _Aegir_ seem to have intended to settle\\r\\nin La Salle County, but in Chicago were advised by two Americans not to\\r\\ngo there. They were also partly influenced by Norwegian immigrants[72]\\r\\nwho were dissatisfied with that locality, and who recommended Iroquois\\r\\nCounty as a more desirable location to settle. They were told that the\\r\\nFox River Valley was a very unhealthy place, the settlers were dying of\\r\\nague and fever, and it was a misfortune that they had ever been induced\\r\\nto locate there. (Knut Langeland also records the fact that the fever\\r\\nraged in the whole of the Fox River Valley from Muskego, in Wisconsin,\\r\\nto the Mississippi River in Illinois, that summer, but that the\\r\\ncondition in La Salle was no worse than elsewhere). So the intending\\r\\nsettlers deputed three men to explore the country for a site for a new\\r\\ncolony.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [72] Björn Anderson seems to have in part been instrumental in\\r\\n       their not going to La Salle County, but there is no evidence\\r\\n       that he recommended Iroquois County as far as I am aware.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese, Ole Rynning, Ingebrigt Brudvig and Ole Nattestad,[73] walked\\r\\nsouth along the line of the present Illinois Central Railroad,\\r\\nselecting the location at Beaver Creek in Iroquois County. Of the\\r\\nfurther history of this unfortunate and short lived colony, the\\r\\nreader may find an account in Dietrichson\\'s brief discussion of the\\r\\nsettlement, or in Langeland\\'s or R. B. Anderson\\'s book. The majority of\\r\\nthe settlers died during the spring in the low and unhealthy climate.\\r\\nOle Rynning himself died and lies buried there. The few survivors\\r\\nleft for La Salle County the following spring. Mons Aadland refused,\\r\\nhowever, to go. He remained in Beaver Creek three years longer; selling\\r\\nhis land in 1840 for a herd of cattle and, moving north, he located in\\r\\nRacine County, being therefore one of the earliest pioneers in this\\r\\npart of Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [73] Niels Veste may also have been of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Rynning\\'s name is most closely associated with the brief history of\\r\\nthe Beaver Creek Settlement. We have already seen above how his book,\\r\\n_Sandfaerdig Beretning om Amerika_, came to have a very far-reaching\\r\\ninfluence upon Norwegian emigration. This book Rynning wrote that\\r\\nwinter in the Beaver Creek Settlement. It was printed in Norway the\\r\\nnext year. It soon became widely distributed and continued for over a\\r\\ndecade to exert a powerful influence upon Norwegian emigration from\\r\\nVoss, east to Hedemarken, and north to Gudbrandsdalen, in these latter\\r\\nprovinces, at the close of the decade, especially.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have, on page 86 above, observed that Rynning formulated certain\\r\\nquestions which he set about answering for the information of intending\\r\\nimmigrants. It will be of interest to note here the nature of some\\r\\nof his answers. The first question as to the nature of the country,\\r\\nhe answers by giving a very intelligent account of the topography and\\r\\nclimate of the country, the soil in the different parts, and of what\\r\\nthe produce of the different sections consists. In answer to the third\\r\\nquestion, he says that the United States is more than twenty times as\\r\\nlarge as Norway, that the greater part of the country is not yet even\\r\\nunder cultivation, and that there is room for a population more than\\r\\na hundred times as great as that of Norway. There need be no fear, he\\r\\nsays, that the country will be full in fifty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth question as to where the Norwegian immigrants have located\\r\\nespecially, he answers by saying, that in New York, Rochester, Detroit,\\r\\nChicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans, there are said to be individual\\r\\nsettlers; but he mentions four places where several have settled,\\r\\nnamely: (1) Orleans County, New York, but where, he says, there are now\\r\\nonly two or three families left; (2) La Salle County, Illinois, where,\\r\\nhe says, there are about twenty families; (3) White County, Indiana, on\\r\\nthe Tippecanoe River. \"Here,\" he says, live \"only two Norwegians from\\r\\nDrammen, who, together, own about eleven hundred acres of land\"; (4)\\r\\nShelby County, Missouri, where a few Norwegians from Stavanger settled\\r\\nin the spring of 1837; (5) Iroquois County, Illinois. \"Here,\" he says,\\r\\n\"there are eleven or twelve families of those who came last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth question as to the land in these localities, he answers by\\r\\npraising the beauty and the fertility of the prairie. And as to the\\r\\nprice of land, he says, that it has hitherto been $1.25 per acre, but\\r\\nthat he has heard that hereafter land is to be divided into three\\r\\nclasses and the price of land of the third class is to be half a dollar\\r\\nan acre. He then offers explicit directions as to how to go about\\r\\nsecuring land. He thereupon gives the prices of livestock at the time,\\r\\nand of produce, etc. A horse, we learn, costs from fifty to a hundred\\r\\ndollars, a yoke of oxen, sixty to eighty. A milk cow with calf, sixteen\\r\\nto twenty, a sheep, two to three, hogs are six to ten dollars a head,\\r\\npork costs three to five shillings a \"mark,\" butter six to twelve, a\\r\\nbarrel of (wheat) flour, eight to ten dollars; a barrel of cornmeal,\\r\\ntwo and a half to three dollars; a barrel of potatoes, one dollar; a\\r\\npound of coffee, twenty shillings; a barrel of salt is five dollars\\r\\n(Norwegian). But in Wisconsin Territory, the prices are two to three\\r\\ntimes higher, while farther south, everything is cheaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he speaks of wages, of religious conditions, law and order, how\\r\\ninstruction for the young is provided, linguistic conditions, health\\r\\nconditions. He discusses life in the new settlements, its trials and\\r\\nattendant evils. As to the Indians, he says: \"They have gone farther\\r\\nwest; one need never fear attack by Indians in Illinois.\" In answer to\\r\\nthe question as to who should emigrate, he warns against unreasonable\\r\\nexpectations; advises farmers, mechanics and tradesmen to come, he who\\r\\nneither can nor will work must never expect, he says, that wealth or\\r\\nluxury will stand ready to receive him. No, in America one gets nothing\\r\\nwithout work, but by work, one can expect to attain to comfortable\\r\\ncircumstances. He thereupon discusses the question of the dangers in\\r\\ncrossing the oceans, which, he says, are less than usually imagined,\\r\\nand the rumor of enslavement of the immigrant. The latter he brands\\r\\nas false, adding, \"yet it is true that many who have not been able\\r\\nto pay their passage, have come upon such terms that they have sold\\r\\nthemselves, or their service, for a certain number of years to some\\r\\nman here in the country. Many are thereby said to have come into bad\\r\\nhands, and have not had it better than slaves. No Norwegian, as far as\\r\\nI know, has fared in this way, nor is it to be feared, if one crosses\\r\\nby a Norwegian ship, and with one\\'s own countrymen.\" In conclusion, I\\r\\nshall cite his opinion on the slave trade which is interesting in the\\r\\ninsight and judgment it gives evidence of, on the part of an immigrant\\r\\nover twenty years before the war:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The northern states are trying in every congress to abolish slavery\\r\\n  in the southern states; but as these always oppose it and appeal\\r\\n  to their right to govern their own internal affairs, there will\\r\\n  probably soon take place a separation between the northern and the\\r\\n  southern states, or else there will be internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Rynning was born in Ringsaker, as the son of Reverend Jens Rynning\\r\\nand wife, Severine Catherine Steen, in 1809. In 1825, the father moved\\r\\nto Snaasen. Having finished his education in 1829, he taught school for\\r\\na time. Then he bought a small farm[74] which he had to give up again,\\r\\nnot being able to pay for it. His ultra democratic sympathies were\\r\\ndispleasing to his conservative father, and an unhappy love affair,\\r\\nwhich his father disapproved of as being a mesalliance, seems, at\\r\\nleast, to have been, in part the cause of his leaving Norway. We have\\r\\nrecited, briefly, his short career in America.[75] Of his nobility of\\r\\ncharacter and the self-sacrificing spirit he showed in helping the\\r\\ngrief-stricken and suffering colonists in the unfortunate Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement, in the spring and summer of 1838, his surviving associates\\r\\ngive ample testimony. His book, _Sandfaerdig Beretning_, was written\\r\\non the sick-bed.[76] When he died, there was only one man in the\\r\\nsettlement who was well enough to make a casket for him from an old oak\\r\\nwhich he hewed down. Rynning was buried out on the prairie, but no one\\r\\nknows now where the spot is.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [74] This he bought of the father of Rev. B. G. Muus, well-known in\\r\\n       Norwegian-American church history, and a long time pastor at\\r\\n       Norway, Goodhue County, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [75] See above p. 103.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [76] Ansten Nattestad, of whom below, took it with him to Norway\\r\\n       that year and got it printed in Christiania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _Some of the Immigrants of 1837. The First Pathfinders\\r\\n                     from Numedal and Telemarken._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the 177 immigrants, who came to America from Stavanger and\\r\\nBergen in 1837, there was a considerable number who embarked from\\r\\nGothenburg, Sweden. These came mostly from Numedal and Telemarken in\\r\\nthe south central part of Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1837 were, also, the brothers, Ole and Ansten\\r\\nNattestad, from Vægli, Numedal, both of whom came via Gothenburg, and\\r\\nHans Barlien, who emigrated with _Enigheden_. These men played such a\\r\\npart in the immigration history of the period as to deserve something\\r\\nmore than a mere mention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad may be regarded as the father of the emigration\\r\\nmovement from Numedal, Norway, from which some of the most successful\\r\\nNorwegian settlements in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, were later\\r\\nrecruited. His brother, Ole Nattestad, became the founder of one of\\r\\nthese settlements, that of Jefferson Prairie, in Rock County, Wisconsin\\r\\n(also extending into Illinois); while Hans Barlien founded the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in Iowa, at Sugar Creek, Lee County. Of the\\r\\ncircumstances which led to the emigration of the Nattestad brothers, an\\r\\ninteresting account appears in _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, pages 82-83.\\r\\nThis, which is an interview with Ole Nattestad, has been reprinted in\\r\\nother works and I shall not take the space for it here. We may note,\\r\\nhowever, that they had received their first news of America upon a\\r\\njourney to the neighborhood of Stavanger in the close of 1836. During\\r\\nChristmas of that year, they were the guests of Even Nubbru in Sigdal,\\r\\na member of the Storthing, and it was his praise of American laws which\\r\\nfirst aroused Ole Nattestad\\'s desire to emigrate, as he had already had\\r\\nsome unpleasant experiences in that respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, 1837, they stood ready to leave for America, having converted\\r\\ntheir possessions into cash, a sum of eight hundred dollars. They\\r\\nwent on _skis_ from Rollaug to Tin, over the mountains and through\\r\\nthe forests to Stavanger. Halsten Halvorson Brække-Eiet, also from\\r\\nRollaug, became a third member of the party. In Stavanger, local\\r\\nofficial hostility to emigration led them into difficulties, and they\\r\\nwere forced to seek safety in flight by night. They went to Tananger,\\r\\nwhere they were more successful, a skipper contracting to take them in\\r\\nhis yacht to Gothenburg. In Gothenburg, they secured passage with a\\r\\nship which carried iron from Sweden to Fall River, Massachusetts. The\\r\\njourney lasted thirty-two days. Thence, they went to New York, where\\r\\nthey met a few Norwegians, and thence again to Rochester. Here they\\r\\nspoke with several members of the sloop party of 1825, now living in\\r\\nRochester, and they were, for a short time, the guests of Lars Olson,\\r\\nas so many others of the immigrants of those years. Hearing that those\\r\\nwho had come to America in 1836 had gone west to La Salle County, they\\r\\ndecided to go there. In Detroit, Ole Nattestad was one day walking\\r\\nabout to view the city, and he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Here I accidentally came upon a man, whom I immediately recognized\\r\\n  by his clothes as a countryman from the western coast of Norway. I\\r\\n  greeted the man, and the meeting was for us both as if two brothers\\r\\n  had met after a long separation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man was one of the passengers on the _Aegir_, who had just then\\r\\narrived in Detroit. The Nattestad party now joined these, all (except\\r\\nN. P. Langeland and family, as we have seen, page 102 above), going\\r\\nwest to Chicago. Here they met Björn Anderson Kvelve, whose unfavorable\\r\\naccount of the Fox River locality first gave them some doubt as to the\\r\\nwisdom of going there. Of the subsequent events, the reader has already\\r\\nbeen told. We shall meet again with both Ole and Ansten Nattestad\\r\\nbelow. Halsten Brække-Eiet later settled in Dodgeville, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans Barlien was from Overgaarden, Trondhjem; he seems to have been\\r\\nthe second emigrant to America from that region. Of him there will\\r\\nbe occasion to speak more in detail in connection with the first\\r\\nNorwegian settlement in Iowa. I desire, here, however, to mention five\\r\\nothers, who came via Gothenburg to America in the same year, namely,\\r\\nErick Gauteson Midböen, Thore Kittilson Svimbil, and John Nelson Rue,\\r\\nwho had large families, and two single men, Gunder Gauteson Midböen\\r\\nand Torsten Ingebrigtson Gulliksrud. These form the advance troupe\\r\\nof emigrants from the Parish of Tin in Upper Telemarken, a region\\r\\nwhich furnished a large share of recruits for the pioneer colonies\\r\\nof Wisconsin and Iowa in the forties and the fifties. Thore Svimbil\\r\\nbecame a pioneer in Blue Mounds, Dane County, where we shall find him\\r\\nlater. Erik Gauteson Midböen, who had a large family, settled in La\\r\\nSalle County, but, says our authority, \"fortune was not kind to him.\"\\r\\nHe later joined the Latter Day Saints and undertook a journey to Norway\\r\\nas a representative of that church, returned to America and died soon\\r\\nafter, about 1850, as near as I can ascertain. Torsten Gulliksrud\\r\\nalso settled in Illinois, but died early. John Nelson Rue will appear\\r\\nlater in our account as one of the founders of the earliest Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement in Winneshiek County, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not know what the circumstances were that led to the emigration\\r\\nof this little group from Upper Telemarken in 1837. It seems not\\r\\nunlikely that the news of America had come to them through copies\\r\\nof letters from Hovland or others, though they may also have had\\r\\ninformation more directly through Knud Slogvig\\'s return. The latter\\r\\ndoes not to me seem so likely, however, for they appear to have made\\r\\nno attempt to secure passage from Stavanger. The departure of this\\r\\ngroup from Tin does not seem to have had any immediate influence upon\\r\\nemigration from that region. The real exodus from Tin does not begin\\r\\ntill 1839, and then as a part of the general movement, but this may\\r\\nhave been aided by letters from those who went thence in 1837. The\\r\\nnumber that in this way took passage via Gothenburg that year may have\\r\\nbeen larger than we have knowledge of. While the number, two hundred,\\r\\nwhich our statistics, cited above, gives as that of the emigration from\\r\\nNorway in 1837 is certainly rather low, it is highly improbable that it\\r\\nwas as high as three hundred, as elsewhere given. A conservative and\\r\\nreasonable estimate would seem to place it at about two hundred and\\r\\nforty or fifty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on the _Aegir_, we mentioned Nils Fröland. He\\r\\nwas one of two, the other being Mons Aadland, to first join Nils P.\\r\\nLangeland in his preparations for emigrating to America. With his\\r\\nwife and children, he located at Beaver Creek, and they were among\\r\\nthe fortunate survivors of that colony. In 1839, he moved to Mission\\r\\nTownship in La Salle County, and to the present Miller Township the\\r\\nnext year. He died there in 1873. His widow (born 1798) was still\\r\\nliving in 1895. A grandson, Lars Fruland, resides at Newark, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnders Nordvig, who also came on the _Aegir_, died in the Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement. His widow, a sister of Knud Langeland, moved to La Salle\\r\\nCounty; she died there at the age of ninety in 1892. A daughter,\\r\\nMalinda, married Iver Lawson (Iver Larson Bö), who came to Chicago\\r\\nfrom Voss, Norway, in 1844. Victor F. Lawson, owner of _The Chicago\\r\\nNews_, is her son. Another daughter, Sarah (born 1824), married a Mr.\\r\\nDarnell, a pioneer of Benton County, Iowa, in 1854. Mrs. Darnell was\\r\\nthe first Norwegian in that county. After Darnell\\'s death, she returned\\r\\nto Illinois, locating at Sandwich, De Kalb County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on _Aegir_, Odd Himle, Baard Haugen, Ole Dyvik\\r\\nand John Björgo went direct to La Salle County. The first of these\\r\\nreturned to Norway in 1844, and, while there, married Marie L. Jermo;\\r\\nhe returned to America in 1845, and settled on Spring Prairie in\\r\\nColumbia County, Wisconsin, where we shall meet with him again. He died\\r\\nin De Forest, Dane County, Wisconsin, in May, 1893. We shall also meet\\r\\nJohn Björgo below as one of the pioneers of Koshkonong, Wisconsin.\\r\\nHalle Væte died in Beaver Creek, as did his wife and grown-up\\r\\ndaughter. Kolbein Saue and Styrk Saue both went to Beaver Creek and\\r\\nwere among the survivors; they came to Koshkonong in 1843 and are to\\r\\nbe remembered among the early pioneers there. Styrk Saue was born in\\r\\nVoss, September twenty-fifth, 1814; his wife, Ellen Olson (born Rekve),\\r\\nwas born in 1816. They were married in America. Nils Bolstad settled\\r\\nin Koshkonong in 1840. He was one of a group of three to visit Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, on a trip of exploration in the fall of 1839, being,\\r\\ntherefore, the first Norwegians in that county.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the passengers on _Enigheden_ was Hans Valder and wife. He was\\r\\nborn on the farm, Vælde, in Vats Parish in Ryfylke in 1813. Having\\r\\nreceived an education he taught school in Tysvæer some years before\\r\\nemigrating. Here he heard much about the earliest emigration to America\\r\\nfrom Stavanger. In Detroit, Valder and Östen Espeland separated from\\r\\nthe rest of the party and went to Adrian, Michigan. Thence they went a\\r\\nfew miles into the country in Lenawee County to visit a small Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement, whither Ingebrigt Larson Narvig had recently moved from\\r\\nMonroe County, where he had settled in 1833.[77] In the spring of\\r\\n1838 Valder left for La Salle County, Illinois. Here he lived until\\r\\n1853, when he moved to what is at present Newburg, Fillmore County,\\r\\nMinnesota, and became one of the earliest Norwegian pioneers in\\r\\nMinnesota. Östen Espeland and family remained at the home of Narvig a\\r\\nlittle longer than Valder, but then they also went to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [77] See above, page 101, for the circumstances of Narvig\\'s coming\\r\\n       to Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother passenger on _Enigheden_ was Christopher Danielson from\\r\\nAardal, in Lower Ryfylke. He was fifty-seven years old at the time of\\r\\nemigrating, settled in Mission Township, La Salle County, where his\\r\\nwife died a few years later. Danielson died of the cholera in 1849.\\r\\nHis son, Christopher Danielson (born in Norway), resides at Sheridan,\\r\\nIllinois. Thomas A. Thompson, born 1812 in Skjold Parish, Ryfylke,\\r\\nsettled in Norway, La Salle County, Illinois. In 1867 he removed to\\r\\nAdams County, Iowa, where he died in 1870. Lars Richolson and wife\\r\\nalso came in 1837, and settled near Ottawa in La Salle County. Lars\\r\\nRicholson, as, indeed, several of the pioneers of these years, soon\\r\\nbecame one of the substantial men of the community.[78] Ole Heier, who\\r\\nalso came in 1837, from Tin, Telemarken, located in La Salle County.\\r\\nHe had been an ardent Haugian, but became a Mormon in Illinois, and\\r\\nlater a Baptist. In 1868 he moved to Iowa, where he died in 1873. A\\r\\nson, A. Hayer, lives in Leland, Illinois. Finally there came that year\\r\\nEven Askvig with wife and children from Hjelmeland Parish in Ryfylke.\\r\\nSettling first in Indiana (Beaver Creek) they removed the next year to\\r\\nLa Salle County, Illinois. Late in the forties they settled in Texas\\r\\nand at last in 1852 the parents and a part of the family located in\\r\\nsouthwestern Iowa, where Even Askvig died in 1875 and his wife in 1881.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [78] Attorney Samuel Richolson, of Ottawa, who died in 1906, was a\\r\\n       son of Lars Richolson. He was born March twenty-fifth, 1841,\\r\\n       on the homestead bought by his father in 1837-38. He was for a\\r\\n       long time member of the firm, Boyle and Richolson, in Ottawa,\\r\\n       was mayor of Ottawa from 1871-1881, at one time attorney\\r\\n       for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad. His widow,\\r\\n       Marietta Richolson, and two children are still living.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Ansten Nattestad\\'s Return to Norway in 1838. The\\r\\n                 Year 1839. Immigration Assumes Larger\\r\\n                 Proportions. The Course of Settlement\\r\\n                               Changes._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal event in Norwegian immigration history for the year,\\r\\n1838, is Ansten Nattestad\\'s return to Norway. We have seen, above, page\\r\\n103, that Ole and Ansten Nattestad left the Beaver Creek settlement in\\r\\nthe spring of 1838. Ansten went to Norway, as it seems, for the express\\r\\npurpose of promoting emigration from Rollaug, Numedal, while Ole went\\r\\nout to explore new fields. Going north as far as the Wisconsin line\\r\\nhe stopped in what is now Clinton Township in Rock County. This place\\r\\nsuited his fancy and he decided to settle here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was July first.[79] He entered a claim of eighty acres and\\r\\nimmediately set to work erecting temporary quarters. For a year he\\r\\nlived alone, rarely coming in contact with a white man, and not seeing\\r\\nanything of his own countrymen during all that time. \"Eight Americans,\"\\r\\nhe says, \"had settled in the town before me, but these also lived\\r\\nin about as lonely and desolate a condition as I. I found the soil\\r\\nespecially fruitful and the melancholy uniformity of the prairie was\\r\\nrelieved here by intervening bits of woods. Flocks of deer and other\\r\\ngame were to be seen daily, and the uncanny howling of the prairie wolf\\r\\nconstantly disturbed my night rest, until the habit fortified my ears\\r\\nagainst disturbances of this kind.\" The following summer, Ole built a\\r\\ncabin in which he received, as we shall see below, the first group of\\r\\nimmigrants into that country in the early fall of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [79] According to Ole Nattestad\\'s letter in _Nordlyset_ for May\\r\\n       eighteenth, 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1838 brought a small contingent of emigrants from Voss.\\r\\nThey were Steffen K. Gilderhus, Knud Lydvo, Ole Lydvo and Lars\\r\\nGjerstad.[80] Gilderhus went to Cleveland, Ohio, being, I believe,\\r\\nthe first Norwegian to locate there; he remained there only one year,\\r\\nhowever, going to Chicago in 1839. We shall later find him among the\\r\\npioneers of Koshkonong, Dane County, Wisconsin. Knud and Ole Lydvo and\\r\\nLars Gjerstad went to La Salle County, Illinois, and thence to Shelby\\r\\nCounty, Missouri, where the restless Kleng Peerson had the year before\\r\\ngone in search of a new locality for a settlement in the southwest (see\\r\\nbelow).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [80] As brought out by Nils A. Lie of Deerfield, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore passing on to the emigration of 1839, it will be in order to\\r\\nspeak briefly of a small group of emigrants from Numedal in the year\\r\\n1838. The name of the leader was Ole Aasland, a wealthy farmer of\\r\\nFlesberg Parish. He sold out his farm and, taking with him his family\\r\\nand about twenty other persons, whose passage he paid for, he sailed\\r\\nfrom Tönsberg, via Gothenburg, and thence to New York. He then went\\r\\nto Orleans County, New York.[81] Here it seems he fell into the hands\\r\\nof speculators, who sold him six hundred acres of marsh land in Noble\\r\\nCounty, Indiana, for a very high price. He removed to that place soon\\r\\nafter, it seems, with most of those whom he had brought from Norway.\\r\\nSickness set in, brought on by the swampiness of the region, and\\r\\nmany of his party died. He thereupon (next year) abandoned the land,\\r\\ntaking with him the survivors. In the Kendall Settlement, Andrew J.\\r\\nStangeland bought the land of him for a nominal price.[82] Aasland, who\\r\\nchanged his name in this country to Orsland, lived on the so-called\\r\\nNorwegian Road in Kendall, till his death, about 1864. In Kendall, he\\r\\naccumulated considerable property. He left a wife and four children,\\r\\nCanute Orsland, and Harry B. Orsland (born 1828 in Kendall), the former\\r\\noccupying the old homestead as late as 1895, and Hallock Orsland living\\r\\nin Detroit, where a daughter is also living. Let us now turn to Ansten\\r\\nNattestad\\'s journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [81] The Kendall Settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [82] Aasland did not take anything for it, says Canute Orsland in\\r\\n       letter of 1895 to R. B. Anderson; letter is printed on page\\r\\n       265 of _First Chapter_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Nattestad\\'s own account he went back to Norway in the\\r\\nspring of 1838 via New Orleans and Liverpool. In Drammen he had printed\\r\\nhis brother\\'s journal, _En Dagbog_, and Rynning\\'s book was printed\\r\\nin Christiania. He speaks of the great interest that these pamphlets\\r\\naroused as well as that of his own return. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"The report of my return spread like wild fire throughout the\\r\\n  country, and an incredibly large number of people came to me to get\\r\\n  news from America. Many even travelled eighteen to twenty Norwegian\\r\\n  miles to speak with me. It was impossible to answer all the letters\\r\\n  that came with reference to conditions across the ocean. In the\\r\\n  spring of 1839 about one hundred persons stood ready to go with me\\r\\n  across the ocean. Among these were many farmers with families, all\\r\\n  except the children able to work and in their best years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were, moreover, a host of people from Telemarken and Numedal, who\\r\\ncould not accompany him, as there was no more room in the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime these people from Telemarken, not to be deterred long\\r\\nin their plans to go to the New World, immediately set about organizing\\r\\ntheir party and went to Skien to seek passage there. They were all\\r\\nfrom Tin and Hjertdal parishes in Upper Telemarken. The leaders of the\\r\\nparty were the Luraas family, which was represented by four heads of\\r\\nfamilies, in all about twenty persons of the total number of forty,\\r\\ncomposed almost exclusively of grown men and women. They embarked at\\r\\nSkien, May seventeenth, somewhat earlier than the party from Numedal\\r\\nand arrived in America before, hence it is to this group that we shall\\r\\nnow turn our attention, leaving for the time being Nattestad and his\\r\\nparty. The Luraas party was in all composed of eleven families,\\r\\nmost of them being from Tin Parish. We have already, under Causes of\\r\\nEmigration, spoken briefly of John Luraas, who perhaps was the chief\\r\\npromoter of this emigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party consisted of John Nelson Luraas, Knut Nelson Luraas,\\r\\nHalvor Östenson Luraas, Torger Östenson Luraas, Halvor T. Lönflok,\\r\\nHalvor Nelson Lohner, Helge Mathieson, Ole Hellikson Kroken, Östen\\r\\nMöllerflaten, Ole Kjonaas, Nils Johnson Kaasa, and the latter\\'s\\r\\nbrother, Gjermund Johnson Kaasa, all of whom had families, besides\\r\\nthree unmarried men, namely, Nils, Ole and John Tollefsjord. The\\r\\nKaasa brothers were from Hiterdal; the rest I believe were all from\\r\\nTin Parish. In Gothenburg they met another small company of Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants, who had just arrived there from Stavanger, bound for\\r\\nAmerica. This party included Gitle Danielson, the leader of the party,\\r\\nfrom the island of Rennesö, a little north of Stavanger, and who had\\r\\na large family, Halvor Jellarviken, with family, and Peder Rosöino,\\r\\nboth with families, Erik Svinalie and sister; the party also included\\r\\nJohn Evenson Molee from Tin in Telemarken, who was at that time in the\\r\\nservice of Gitle Danielson. In all there were now about sixty. The\\r\\njourney across the Atlantic took nine weeks and the journey from Boston\\r\\nto Milwaukee took another three weeks. The latter led by way of New\\r\\nYork and then by canal boats, pulled by horses, to Buffalo; thence by\\r\\nway of the Great Lakes to Milwaukee, the most common westward route\\r\\nfor the early immigrants. This was at the close of August. It was the\\r\\nintention of the emigrants to settle in La Salle County, Illinois; but\\r\\nin Milwaukee they were induced to remain in Wisconsin, and a site for a\\r\\nsettlement was selected near Lake Muskego in the southeastern part of\\r\\nWaukesha County, about twenty miles southwest from Milwaukee.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story is told how it came about that they did not go to Illinois\\r\\nas originally intended. A good-natured fat man is said to have been\\r\\npointed out to them as the product of Wisconsin. On the other hand\\r\\nIllinois was described as a hot and unhealthy region in substantiation\\r\\nof which a pale, sickly man was presented as the result of life in that\\r\\nstate. Whether this was done or not I do not know; but the story may\\r\\nserve as an illustration of frontier humor and immigrant credulity both.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffice it to say that the people of Milwaukee succeeded in diverting\\r\\nthe immigrants from Telemarken from going any farther, but selected a\\r\\nsite for a settlement, as we have said, near Lake Muskego in Waukesha\\r\\nCounty. Then they returned to Milwaukee to perfect their purchase\\r\\nof land there, the price paid being the usual one of a dollar and\\r\\ntwenty-five cents per acre.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore reciting further the fortunes of this group of immigrants, the\\r\\nfirst to enter the State of Wisconsin, let us turn for a moment to a\\r\\nconsideration of the larger movement. With the year 1839, emigration\\r\\nfrom Norway begins to assume larger proportions, and certain districts,\\r\\nwhich hitherto had sent very few, now begin to contribute the larger\\r\\nshare of the number of emigrants to America. This year may very\\r\\nproperly be said to have inaugurated the second period in Norwegian\\r\\nimmigration history. Down to 1839 the immigration movement in Norway\\r\\nhad not really gone beyond the provinces of Stavanger and South\\r\\nBergenhus in southwestern and western Norway. Indeed, nearly all of\\r\\nthe emigrants had come from these sections. In fact, before 1836 the\\r\\nmovement was almost confined to Stavanger and Ryfylke. In that year\\r\\nit reaches Hardanger, and in 1837, Bergen. It does not reach Voss\\r\\nproperly before 1838, although Nils Röthe and wife had emigrated from\\r\\nthere in 1836. In 1837, as we have seen, the first emigrant ship, the\\r\\n_Aegir_, left Bergen with eighty-four passengers. Before 1839 we meet\\r\\nwith occasional individual emigration from provinces to the east and\\r\\nnortheast. Thus Ole Rynning and Snaasen in Trondhjem Diocese emigrated\\r\\nin the _Aegir_ in 1837. The first emigrants from Telemarken also came\\r\\nin 1837. As we have seen above, 1837 is also the year which records\\r\\nthe first immigration from Numedal. Among the emigrants from other\\r\\nparts of Norway prior to 1837 must be mentioned also Johan Nordboe,\\r\\nfrom Ringebo in Guldbrandsdalen, who came in 1832 and resided for some\\r\\ntime in Kendall, New York, later going to Texas, and Hans Barlien from\\r\\nTrondhjem County, who came to La Salle County in 1837. Neither of these\\r\\ntwo men, however, were instrumental in bringing about any emigration\\r\\nmovement in Gudbrandsdalen and Trondhjem. It is not until a much later\\r\\nperiod that these two districts are represented in considerable numbers\\r\\namong emigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the year 1839 in which emigration on a larger scale takes its\\r\\nbeginnings. Similarly, the year 1839 marks a change also in the\\r\\nmovement of the course of settlement. Down to this time all emigration\\r\\nfrom Norway stands in direct relation to the movement which began in\\r\\nStavanger in 1825, and which in the years 1834-36 resulted in the\\r\\nformation of the Fox River Settlement in La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\nThis settlement then became the center of dispersion for what may be\\r\\ncalled the southern line of settlements. All through the forties and\\r\\nthe fifties the southern course of migration westward, which includes\\r\\nsouthern and central Iowa, stands in direct relation to early Norwegian\\r\\ncolonization in New York and Illinois,--that is the first period\\r\\nof Norwegian emigration from the provinces of Stavanger and South\\r\\nBergenhus (and this province only as far north as Bergen, Voss being\\r\\nexcluded) in Southwestern Norway. In 1839 the first settlements are\\r\\nformed in Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Muskego in Waukesha County,\\r\\nand in Rock County; and in 1839-40 that of Koshkonong in Dane and\\r\\nJefferson Counties. These settlements then became a northern point\\r\\nof dispersion. From here we have a second northern line of settlement\\r\\nwestward and northwestward into Northern Iowa, Minnesota, and the more\\r\\nnortherly localities of Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Shelby County, Missouri. Ansten Nattestad\\'s Return\\r\\n                from Norway in 1839. The Founding of the\\r\\n                  Jefferson Prairie Settlement in Rock\\r\\n                          County, Wisconsin._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore returning now to the thread of our narrative, I wish to speak\\r\\nbriefly of an early effort, and the only one, before the fifties, to\\r\\nfound a settlement from the southern point of dispersion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1837 Kleng Peerson, Jacob and Knud Slogvig, Andrew Askeland, Andrew\\r\\nSimonson, Thorstein Thorson Rue, several of whom had families, and\\r\\nabout eight others, left La Salle County, went to Missouri and made\\r\\na settlement in Shelby County; this, however, proved unsuccessful,\\r\\nprincipally on account of the lack of a market.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeerson does not seem to have selected a very desirable locality, and\\r\\nhe did not possess the steadfastness of purpose that would seem to\\r\\nbe a prime requisite in the pioneer. He was too much of a lover of\\r\\nadventure, and hardly was a plan brought to completion before his head\\r\\nwas again full of new dreams and fancies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was something of a Peer Gynt but without Peer Gynt\\'s selfishness\\r\\nor his eye for the main chance; the roving spirit dominated Peerson\\r\\nwholly; not until old age had laid its hand on him did he yield to the\\r\\nmonotony of a settled life; but even then in the wilderness of Texas\\r\\nin the fifties. I have personal information of his life there; he took\\r\\nno part in the upbuilding of the community, no active interest in its\\r\\nprogress. In a settled community he alone was unsettled; he was never\\r\\nable to gather himself together into concentrated action and prolonged\\r\\neffort in a definite cause or undertaking. A vagabond citizen, he\\r\\ndied in poverty. The only activity we associate with his name is the\\r\\nadventurous wanderings of his youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having spent a year in Missouri Peerson returned to Norway,\\r\\nevidently for the purpose of recruiting his colony, but I have no\\r\\nevidence that he succeeded in this. Independent of Peerson\\'s efforts,\\r\\nthe little colony did receive an accession of three in 1838, namely,\\r\\nKnud and Ole Lydvo and Lars Gjerstad, and of one person in the fall of\\r\\n1839, namely, Nils Lydvo, who had just come from Voss, Norway, with a\\r\\ngroup of immigrants from that region, most of whom remained in Chicago.\\r\\nThe Shelby County settlement did not thrive. It was too far removed\\r\\nfrom other settlers, too far from a market; the settlers suffered want\\r\\nand became discouraged. The colony was practically broken up in 1840,\\r\\nwhen most of the settlers removed north into Iowa Territory into what\\r\\nis now Lee County. Here they established the first Norwegian settlement\\r\\nin Iowa. Of this we shall have occasion to speak under the year 1840.\\r\\nLet us now return to Ansten Nattestad and his party of emigrants, whom\\r\\nwe left above, page 119, as about to depart for America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad\\'s party of one hundred then sailed from Drammen by\\r\\nthe _Emelia_, Captain Ankerson, late in the spring of 1839. It was the\\r\\nfirst time, says he, that the people of Drammen had seen an emigrant\\r\\nship. Every person paid thirty-three dollars and a half (specie); they\\r\\nwere nine weeks on the ocean, going direct to New York. They took the\\r\\nusual route inland and arrived in Milwaukee just at the time when\\r\\nthe Luraas party had returned to Milwaukee to purchase land already\\r\\nselected in Waukesha County, as we have seen above. They urged the\\r\\nnew arrivals to stop in Milwaukee and go with them to Muskego, but\\r\\nNattestad objected, and so they continued their journey to Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Ansten learned that his brother had located in Wisconsin the year\\r\\nbefore. The party\\'s destination was La Salle County, but this changed\\r\\nthe course of some of them. Some who had friends there did go to La\\r\\nSalle County, a few remained in Chicago, especially single men, but\\r\\nthe majority went with Ansten to Clinton. All these (excepting some\\r\\nto be noted below) bought land and began the life of pioneers there\\r\\nin the fall of 1839 on what came to be known as Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\nBesides Ole Knudson Nattestad and his brother Ansten, those who\\r\\nfounded this settlement were: Halvor Pederson Haugen, Hans Gjermundson\\r\\nHaugen, Thore Helgeson Kirkejord, Torsten Helgeson Kirkejord, Jens\\r\\nGudbrandson Myhra, Gudbrand, Myhra, Erik Skavlem, the brothers Kittil\\r\\nand Kristoffer Nyhus, and T. Nelson. Halvor Haugen did not come with\\r\\nthe Nattestad party, although he was in Drammen intending to sail on\\r\\nthe _Emelia_. Owing to lack of room about thirty persons, including\\r\\nchildren, had to be left behind. Halvor Haugen has himself told (in\\r\\n_Amerika_, September, 1907) of the coming of these. After several\\r\\ndays of waiting, they secured passage on a boat bound for Gothenburg,\\r\\nSweden. The journey went via Fredrikshald, where another stay of two\\r\\nor three days took place. At Gothenburg a wait of ten days followed\\r\\nbefore the brig _Bunyan_, on which they were to sail, was ready. \"It\\r\\nwas certainly fortunate,\" says our narrator, \"that people were not in\\r\\nsuch haste then, or the repeated delays of several days duration would\\r\\nhave been the cause of much unpleasant irritation.\" Landing in Boston,\\r\\nthe immigrants travelled by rail to Providence, Rhode Island, thence by\\r\\nsteamboat to New York. Here they boarded the boat which was to carry\\r\\nthem to Albany. As they were told the boat was not to leave before\\r\\nfive o\\'clock in the afternoon most of the men of the party went ashore\\r\\nagain to purchase food. When they returned however the boat had sailed\\r\\nhaving left at ten in the forenoon instead of five in the afternoon as\\r\\nplanned. Those left behind managed to reach their destination also,\\r\\nthough with many difficulties and unpleasant experiences. From Albany\\r\\nthey travelled by canal to Buffalo. \"Of this part of the journey,\"\\r\\nsays Haugen, \"there is nothing to be said except that, like all other\\r\\nearthly things, this also at last came to an end.\" From Buffalo the\\r\\njourney went by steamboat to Chicago. They did not go thence to La\\r\\nSalle County though undoubtedly intended originally to do so. I do not\\r\\nknow what changed their course, but on the next day after arriving in\\r\\nChicago, they went to Du Page County, Illinois, where a week later they\\r\\nmet those who had gone with Nattestad in Captain Ankerson\\'s ship. The\\r\\nparty whose coming has thus briefly been related was composed of Halvor\\r\\nHaugen, wife, three sons, Peder, Halvor and Andreas, and two daughters\\r\\nBergit and Sigrid; Halvor Stordok, Lars Haugerud, Gunder Fingalpladsen,\\r\\nEngebret Sæter, Lars Dalen, Gjermund Johnson, and Sven Tufte, all of\\r\\nwhom also had families, besides some single persons. Halvor Haugen\\'s\\r\\nfamily and most of the party remained in Du Page County for a time,\\r\\nand Peder Haugen and his brother Andreas and the two sisters secured\\r\\nemployment there. The father, however, went with Erik Skavlem to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie to help him build a house. At Christmas the rest of\\r\\nthe party also went to Jefferson Prairie. During the winter they all\\r\\nlived in Skavlem\\'s house. This house is described as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"It was sixteen by sixteen and quite low. In order to add to room\\r\\n  \\'crowns\\' were erected overhead, that is, beams which were laid\\r\\n  crosswise near the ceiling. These beams were cut pointed at the\\r\\n  ends which were made to rest between the logs in the walls on\\r\\n  either side, like riders across the house. On top of these again\\r\\n  was laid flats, on which beds were arranged. Down below on the\\r\\n  floor there were also three beds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA writer in _Amerika_, March first, 1907, quotes one of the immigrants\\r\\nas speaking of the cramped quarters in the log cabin, in which the\\r\\nwhole party lived that fall and winter; room which to one family would\\r\\nseem too small now. \"How these settlers,\" he says, \"could manage in\\r\\none log cabin a whole winter is a riddle to me.\" The following spring\\r\\nHalvor Haugen also built a cabin which was always full as newcomers\\r\\nwere constantly arriving. At the same time other cabins were erected\\r\\nby Kittil and Kristoffer Nyhus, Gudbrand and Jens Myhra, and Torsten\\r\\nKirkejorden. Two years later all of these built new and more commodious\\r\\nhouses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement thus founded exclusively by immigrants from the district\\r\\nof Numedal has always continued to be recruited largely from that\\r\\nregion (see, however, below). In the following year a few more families\\r\\ncame from Numedal, while from 1841 the accessions were considerable\\r\\nevery year for a number of years. Among these is to be mentioned Bergit\\r\\nNelson Kallerud, from Vægli, who also came in the ship _Emilia_,\\r\\nin 1839, but who does not seem to have gone directly to Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie. She married Jens Gudbrandson Myhra at Christmas, 1839, while\\r\\nhis brother, Gudbrand Myhra, married Ambjör Olson (also from Vægli)\\r\\nin 1840. The following year they, however, moved to the Rock Prairie\\r\\nSettlement (see below), and in 1852 they settled in Mitchell County,\\r\\nIowa. In connection with the settling of this county we shall have\\r\\noccasion to speak again more fully of them. Jens Myhra was born in\\r\\nVægli, Numedal, in 1812.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: Map of Southern and Central Norway\\r\\n                 See Appendix for names of parishes here numbered.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the other founders of this settlement I may here add the following\\r\\nfacts. Ole Knudson Nattestad was born at Vægli, in Rollaug Parish,\\r\\nDecember twenty-fourth, 1807. We have above given an account of his\\r\\nsettling at Clinton. In _Nordlyset_ for May eighteenth, 1848, there\\r\\nappeared a communication from Nattestad relative to this occasion, in\\r\\nwhich he rightly claims to have been the first Norwegian to settle\\r\\nin the state. He married there Lena Hiser in 1840; he lived in the\\r\\nsettlement, as an influential, respected member of the community, till\\r\\nhis death, which occurred at Clinton, May twenty-eighth, 1886. His wife\\r\\ndied in September, 1888. They left seven children; Henry Nattestad,\\r\\nthe oldest, at present occupies the homestead. The other children are,\\r\\nCharles (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), James (Dakota), Ann (Clinton),\\r\\nJulia (Mrs. Martin Scofftedt Lawrence, Kansas), Caroline (Mrs. Louis O.\\r\\nLarson, Clinton), and Eliza (Clinton). Ansten Nattestad was born August\\r\\ntwenty-sixth, 1813, the youngest of three brothers. Ole was the next\\r\\noldest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir father, Knud Nattestad, was a man of some means, but by the right\\r\\nof primogeniture, the oldest inherited the estate and he remained\\r\\nin Norway. Of these things and the early life of the two younger\\r\\nbrothers, Ole Nattestad gives an account in an interview printed in\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_, 1869, where also is a detailed account of Ansten\\r\\nNattestad\\'s coming to America with his group of one hundred immigrants\\r\\nin 1839. He also there, pages 107-108, gives a description of the\\r\\nsettlement as it was in 1869, and he has elsewhere in the columns of\\r\\nthat magazine made important contributions to the immigration history\\r\\nof the years 1838-1840, which now are among the original sources of\\r\\nmaterial for a history of Norwegian immigration. Relative to the\\r\\nfurther career of Ansten Nattestad I shall only add here that he became\\r\\none of the substantial members of this great and growing settlement, in\\r\\nwhich he continued to live until his death on April eighth, 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans G. Haugen was born at Vægli in Rollaug Parish in 1785. He was\\r\\nan old soldier, having been in the Norwegian-Swedish War of 1814,\\r\\nand having served in the Norwegian army for seven years. His wife,\\r\\nwhose maiden name was Sigrid Pedersdatter Valle, was born in January,\\r\\n1803. The family consisted further of two sons, Gunnul and Gjermund,\\r\\nthe former born at Vægli, April twenty-eighth, 1827, the latter on\\r\\nSeptember nineteenth, 1836. The father, Hans Haugen, lived only a year\\r\\nafter coming to America; he died in October, 1840. In 1849 the widow\\r\\nand two sons moved to Primrose, Dane County, Wisconsin, where we shall\\r\\nmeet with them again. Sigrid Haugen died in Beloit in 1885. It may be\\r\\nadded here that the family took the name of Jackson in this country. Of\\r\\nthe circumstances that led to the adoption of this name the son gives\\r\\nan account which appeared in Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, etc., page two\\r\\nhundred sixty-three.\\r\\n\\r\\nThore Helgeson Kirkejord[83] was born September twelfth, 1812;\\r\\nmarried in 1837. They had one daughter, Christie, born 1849, and\\r\\nwho is married to Gunder Larson.[84] Thore Helgeson died in Clinton\\r\\nin 1871. Christopher C. Nyhus (Newhouse) was born at Vægli in July,\\r\\n1812. When he came to Clinton Township he first entered claim to\\r\\nforty acres of land, which was later increased to a hundred sixty. He\\r\\nmarried a daughter of Halvor Halvorson in the fall of 1843. They had\\r\\nfive children, Christopher, who died in infancy, Oliver, Christopher\\r\\n2d, Torrena (Mrs. Gustav Nelson, Clinton), and Christiana. T. Nelson\\r\\nsettled on section twenty in 1839; he married Rachel Gilbertson that\\r\\nyear. They had five children. The son, T. T. Nelson, married Mary\\r\\nTangen of Manchester, Illinois, in 1872. They have two daughters, Anna\\r\\nR. (b. 1875), Gertine (b. 1878).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [83] Whose name appears as Torro Holgeson in _The History of Rock\\r\\n       County, Wisconsin_, 1879, p. 780, to which work I am indebted\\r\\n       for some of the facts recited above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [84] They again have four children. Mr. Larson enlisted in the 42d\\r\\n       Illinois Regiment, later transferred to the Mississippi Marine\\r\\n       Brigade, was at the battle of Vicksburg, served faithfully and\\r\\n       was honorably discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Earliest White Settlers on Rock and Jefferson\\r\\n               Prairies. The Founding of the Rock Prairie\\r\\n               Settlement. The Earliest Settlers on Rock\\r\\n                                Prairie_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that when Ole Nattestad settled at Clinton on July first,\\r\\n1838, the country was a wilderness, he being the only white man there.\\r\\nHe speaks, however, of eight Americans living some distance from him,\\r\\nin similar condition. It was less than three years prior that the first\\r\\nwhite settlers had located in the county. On the eighteenth day of\\r\\nNovember, 1835, John Inman, of Lucerne County, Pennsylvania, Thomas\\r\\nHolmes, William Holmes, and Joshua Holmes, of Ohio, Milo Jones and\\r\\nGeorge Follmer, settled on the site of the present city of Janesville,\\r\\nopposite the \"big rock.\"[85] This was the first settlement in Rock\\r\\nCounty. Inman and William Jones had visited the locality and selected\\r\\nthis spot in July of that year. On this occasion they had camped on\\r\\nthe bluff on the Racine road. Our authority relates: \"From this point\\r\\nthey saw Rock Prairie stretching away in the distance to the east and\\r\\nsouth, till the verdant plain mingled with the blue of the horizon.\\r\\nThey saw before them an ocean of waving grass and blooming flowers, and\\r\\nrealized the idea of having found the real Canaan--the real paradise\\r\\nof the world.\" They returned to Milwaukee, having in their ten days\\'\\r\\nexploration of the Rock River Valley, found but one family, namely,\\r\\na Mr. McMillan, who resided where Waukesha now stands.[85] Somewhat\\r\\nlater in the year came Samuel St. John and his wife, the last being\\r\\nthe first white woman in the county. The next year there were several\\r\\nnew arrivals. On December seventh, 1836, townships one, two, three,\\r\\nand four north of ranges eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, of\\r\\nthe fourth principal meridian, afterwards the eastern sixteen of the\\r\\npresent twenty townships of Rock County,[86] were taken from Milwaukee\\r\\nCounty and constituted a separate county, called Rock. The county\\r\\ntook its name from the \"big rock\" on the north side of the river, now\\r\\nwithin the city limits of Janesville, and an ancient landmark among the\\r\\nIndians and the early traders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [85] _History of Rock County_, p. 335.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [86] Avon, Spring Valley, Magnolia and Union being added in 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these earliest settlements (1836-1837) were made near and along\\r\\nthe Rock River. In 1838 there were four hundred and eighty settled\\r\\nin this region chiefly, the centers of population being already then\\r\\nJanesville and Beloit. Next follow Johnstown, Lima, and Milton, in the\\r\\nnorthwestern part of the county, and Union. The region west of Beloit,\\r\\nNewark, Avon, Spring Valley, was still wholly unsettled in the summer\\r\\nof 1839. The Town of Bradford, the next north of Clinton, was first\\r\\nsettled by Erastus Dean, in 1836; there were very few before 1838.\\r\\nThe Town of Clinton, as originally organized (1842), comprised the\\r\\nterritory of the present town, the south half of Bradford, and portions\\r\\nof Turtle and La Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first actual settlement in the present township was made in May,\\r\\n1837, on the west side of Jefferson Prairie, by Stephen E. Downer and\\r\\nDaniel Tasker, and their wives, on the southeast side of the prairie.\\r\\nIn July, Oscar H. Pratt and Franklin Mitchell, from Joliet, Illinois,\\r\\nmade claims. These were the earliest. On the west side of the prairie\\r\\nsettlement was made in October, 1837, by H. L. Warner, Henry Tuttle,\\r\\nAlbert Tuttle, and Griswold Weaver. We recall that Ole Nattestad said\\r\\nthat when he came to Clinton on July first, 1838, there were eight\\r\\nAmericans living isolated at considerable distance from him. Nattestad\\r\\nlocated on section twenty. Here Christopher Nyhus also settled, while\\r\\nThore Helgeson settled on section twenty-nine. Who the eight settlers\\r\\nwere that Nattestad met, remains somewhat uncertain, but it does not\\r\\nseem unlikely that it was the four last mentioned, and some of the\\r\\nfirst explorers, who are named as Charles Tuttle, Dennis Mills, Milton\\r\\nS. Warner, and William S. Murrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Turtle, directly west of Clinton, was not organized\\r\\nuntil 1846. The first settlers were S. G. Colley, who located on\\r\\nsection thirty-two, in the spring of 1838, and Daniel D. Egery, who\\r\\ncame there about the same time, locating on section thirty-six (to\\r\\nBeloit, however, in 1837). Such were the beginnings of settlement east\\r\\nof Beloit prior to Nattestad\\'s coming, and it was still virtually\\r\\na wilderness when Ansten Nattestad\\'s party came at the close of\\r\\nSeptember, 1839. West of Beloit, in the Town of Newark, the Norwegians\\r\\nwere the first, while in Avon and Spring Valley they were among the\\r\\nearliest groups of settlers. It is the settlement of this region, and\\r\\nespecially the Town of Newark, to which we shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observed above that some of Ansten Nattestad\\'s party who came to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie in September, 1839, did not remain there. These\\r\\nwent fourteen miles farther west and established a settlement in the\\r\\nTownship of Newark, which had not been settled by white men before,\\r\\nwhile a few of the members of this latter party went south from there\\r\\neighteen miles, crossing the Illinois line, and located in the Township\\r\\nof Rock Run, in Stephenson County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founder of the Rock Prairie Settlement was Gullik Olson Gravdal, of\\r\\nVægli, Numedal; he emigrated from Norway with Ansten Nattestad in 1839.\\r\\nHe came directly to Jefferson Prairie, but did not remain there. With\\r\\nGisle Halland and Goe Bjöno he went west a distance to look over the\\r\\ncountry, with a view to settling elsewhere. Having arrived at Beloit,\\r\\nthey managed here to secure a map and from it got some idea of where\\r\\ngovernment land was to be had. Then they continued their journey along\\r\\nthe Madison road seven miles farther west. Finally, he came to a place\\r\\nwhich suited him, for he found, as he says, \"good spring water, as\\r\\nalso prairie and woodland in the right proportion.\" Together with Lars\\r\\nRöste, a single man from the Parish of Land, he then bought forty acres\\r\\nof land.[87] Gisle Halland bought land one mile farther east, while\\r\\nGoe Bjöno took a claim on a piece of land for Mrs. Gunhild Ödegaarden,\\r\\nthree miles south of the site selected by Gravdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [87] Röste later went back to Norway, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunhild Ödegaarden (who emigrated from Nore, annex parish in Numedal)\\r\\nwas a widow of considerable means, who had paid the passage of several\\r\\nother persons. Her family, among whom were grown sons and daughters,\\r\\nemigrated with her to America in the Nattestad party and came directly\\r\\nto Jefferson Prairie. Immediately after Bjöno\\'s purchase of land for\\r\\nher in Newark Township she, with family, moved out there and had a log\\r\\ncabin erected, this being the first dwelling built in that township.\\r\\nThis statement is based upon the authority of Gravdal himself, as\\r\\nprinted in an interview on page 162 of _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869. _The\\r\\nHistory of Rock County_ agrees in this statement that Mrs. Ödegaarden\\'s\\r\\nlog cabin, built in the fall of 1839, was the first house erected in\\r\\nthe Town of Newark. Gunhild Ödegaarden\\'s name appears regularly as Mrs.\\r\\nGunale (or Gunile). She is there mentioned several times, her family\\r\\nbeing extensively intermarried with the old pioneer families in the\\r\\nsettlement.[88] Gravdal completed the erection of a cabin late in the\\r\\nfall, and his family having been left on Jefferson Prairie, he brought\\r\\nthem to Rock Prairie in the latter part of November (_Billed-Magazin_,\\r\\n1869, page 162).[89]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [88] Thus Ole Gulack Gravdal, son of Gullik Gravdal, married Juri\\r\\n       Ödegaarden (given as Juri Gunale in _The Rock County History_)\\r\\n       in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [89] There can be no doubt as to the correctness of the facts\\r\\n       as here given. It has also been said that Lars Skavlem\\'s\\r\\n       house was the first to be erected, and J. W. C. Dietrichson\\r\\n       erroneously even names him as the first Norwegian in Rock\\r\\n       Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same fall Gisle Halland married Margit Knudsdatter Nösterud\\r\\nfrom Rallaug Parish, Numedal, being obliged to go as far south as\\r\\nRockford, Illinois, to get the ceremony performed. Their oldest child,\\r\\nKristine, born in the fall of 1840, was the first white child born in\\r\\nthat township. Gravdal, speaking of those days, says: \"When I located\\r\\nin this region, the whole country to the west was a desert. I do not\\r\\nknow whether there lived white people anywhere between my home and the\\r\\nMississippi. The same was also the case toward the north; however,\\r\\nabout seven miles west (east?) from my home two Yankees had settled in\\r\\nthe wilderness. The Indians were still lords of these regions. They\\r\\noften visited us in our houses, but they were always friendly and\\r\\ncourteous. We were never molested by the wild son of the desert. There\\r\\nwas at this time an abundance of game; we saw stags in large herds,\\r\\nand prairie chickens literally swarmed.\" There seem to have been no\\r\\nfresh accessions of settlers until the spring of 1841. Then Lars H.\\r\\nSkavlem arrived and located on section eleven. Gullik Knudson Laugen\\r\\nalso came at the same time, and not long after several Americans moved\\r\\nin. Both Skavlem and Knudson had come to America in 1839, having been\\r\\nmembers of Nattestad\\'s party. Skavlem had, in the interval, lived on\\r\\nJefferson Prairie. Gullik Knudson had remained in Chicago, as had also\\r\\nGunnul Stordok, securing work there,[90] as did also two girls from\\r\\nNumedal, to whom they were engaged in Norway. These two couples were\\r\\nmarried the following winter, and, having saved some money from their\\r\\nsmall earnings, they decided to buy a home somewhere in the Norwegian\\r\\nsettlement in Rock County. Knudson relates: \"I walked about several\\r\\ndays to find a location for a home, and at last came to a place on\\r\\nthe verge of a prairie, where a rushing spring of water poured out of\\r\\nthe ground. Here I decided to build and live, and I called the place\\r\\n_Springen_ (the spring). The land about was like a desert; barring the\\r\\nfour Norwegians who had come before me, there were no settlers. Toward\\r\\nthe west one had to travel twenty-two miles to find white people. It\\r\\nwas fortunate that there was an abundance of game, for what we secured\\r\\nby hunting was the sustenance on which we chiefly relied during the\\r\\nwinter.\" He tells how, with the first fall of snow, he and another[91]\\r\\nwalked on _skis_ to Beloit to buy flour, and how the tracks left in the\\r\\nsnow by the skis had aroused considerable wonder and speculation among\\r\\nthe Americans about there, who afterwards discovered the tracks, and\\r\\nthat it became the subject of extensive discussion as to what unknown\\r\\nmonster could have left such tracks. Beloit, he says, consisted then of\\r\\na mill, a hotel, two stores, and a few laborers\\' cottages.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [90] His wages were from six to ten dollars a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [91] Whom we now know to have been Hellik Glaim.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fact of his location near the big spring, \"Springen,\" as\\r\\nKnudson called it, he came to be called Gullik Springen; his sir name,\\r\\nLaugen, he no longer used, but wrote himself Gullik Knudson. Here\\r\\nby this spring, Knudson built a hut of shrubs, thatched with straw,\\r\\nin which they lived for three months while the log cabin was being\\r\\nbuilt.[92] The flat cover of a chest, brought from Norway, served for\\r\\na table, and the cooking was done on the ground. In December the log\\r\\ncabin was ready. Gunnul Stordok and wife, who did not come to Newark\\r\\nuntil September, lived with Knudson during the first winter, after\\r\\nwhich they removed to Illinois.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [92] This log cabin is still used as a chicken house on the old\\r\\n       Springen homestead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [93] _The Rock County History_ says of Stordok: \"He and his family\\r\\n       lived in a haystack for three months until they had completed\\r\\n       a log cabin\" (page 774). As we have seen, it was not a\\r\\n       haystack they lived in. Stordok\\'s family consisted, as yet,\\r\\n       only of himself and wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1841 a considerable number of Knudson\\'s acquaintances\\r\\nfrom Norway came; these found a temporary home with Knudson, sharing\\r\\nin his genuine pioneer hospitality. Among them were Halvor Skavlem\\r\\nand his wife, Berit, the daughter, Kari, and two sons, Ole and Paul\\r\\nSkavlem, the latter with wife and child, Bessie. Halvor Skavlem died\\r\\none week after their arrival. The son Paul bought land; Ole first,\\r\\nhowever, went to Mineral Point, in Dodge County, returning, however,\\r\\nlater; he settled near Orfordville. Another of this group was Halvor\\r\\nNilson Aas, who, with his family, settled near Gravdahl, in Newark\\r\\nTownship. Knut Kristensen also came in 1841 and located on section\\r\\neleven, erecting a log cabin there. Finally, Ole Halvorson Valle, who\\r\\nlater moved to Iowa, was among this number.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of those who had come to Jefferson Prairie in 1839 removed to\\r\\nRock Prairie in the summer of 1841. Thus, Hellik Glaim, Lars Skavlem,\\r\\nand the latter\\'s three brothers, Gullik, Gjermund, and Herbrand; these\\r\\nall moved there upon their father Halvor\\'s arrival from Norway that\\r\\nsummer. Hellik N. Brække and Nils Olson Vægli came directly from Norway\\r\\nin 1841. The last mentioned was from Vægli Annex to Rollaug Parish in\\r\\nNumedal. He was born at Vægli Parsonage and was therefore often called\\r\\nNils Prestegaard. He lived at Gravdal\\'s the first winter; the following\\r\\nsummer he, with two others, Paul Skavlem and Hellik Brække, bought a\\r\\nquarter section of land together in section thirty-two in Plymouth\\r\\nTownship. Nils Vægli was married in 1844 to Kari Skavlem, daughter\\r\\nof Halvor Skavlem; they went to Koshkonong, in Dane County, to be\\r\\nmarried by Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson, who had just come there from\\r\\nNorway. They were one of the first couples to be married by him. Hellik\\r\\nBrække sold out his share in the land, and in 1852 moved to Mitchell\\r\\nCounty, Iowa. Lars Skavlem bought land and settled near Halvor Aas,\\r\\nwhose daughter (Groe Nelson) he married in 1844; hence, he was also\\r\\ncalled Lars Aas. He later bought his father-in-law\\'s farm, the place\\r\\nbeing called \"the Skavlen farm\" (Skavlenfarmen). Gullik Skavlem bought\\r\\nland three miles east of Gisle Halland in Beloit Township, about three\\r\\nmiles from Beloit; he, however, moved to Mitchell County, Iowa, in the\\r\\nfifties.[94] Hellik Glaim had stopped in Chicago till 1840, when he\\r\\ncame to Rock Prairie. Ten years later he sold out and moved to Fillmore\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [94] Of these various removals to Mitchell County, Iowa, I shall\\r\\n       speak more fully in the proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [95] Glaim located at Hanley Falls, Minnesota, in 1866.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is a brief record of the beginnings of the Rock Prairie\\r\\nSettlement. Of some of the founders of this settlement, which, in a few\\r\\nyears, became one of the most prosperous in the state, I may here add:\\r\\n\\r\\nGullik Gravdal, the nestor of the settlement, was born in Vægli,\\r\\nNumedal, in 1802; he died in 1873, leaving widow, a daughter, Sarah,\\r\\nand two sons, Ole and Tolle. Ole Gravdal was born in Norway in\\r\\n1830; he married Jöri Ödegaarden in 1855, after which he lived for\\r\\nthirteen years in Beloit, then removed to Newark Township. He is at\\r\\npresent living in Beloit, Wisconsin. Ole Gravdal dropped the latter\\r\\nname and used the patronymic Gulack. Tolle Gulack Gravdal was born\\r\\nin 1833. He married Bessie Skavlem, daughter of Paul H. Skavlem, in\\r\\n1857. They lived on the farm in Newark until 1894 (Tolle having lived\\r\\nthere fifty-five years), in which year they moved to Beloit. He died\\r\\nin September, 1903, leaving a widow and two children, a son, Gilbert\\r\\nGravdal, in Newark Township, and a daughter, Mrs. C. E. Inman, in\\r\\nBeloit. A son, Henry, died in 1902, and a daughter, Nellie (Mrs.\\r\\nW. O. Hanson), died in the summer of 1903. _Amerika_ for September\\r\\ntwenty-fifth, 1903, prints an obituary notice of Tolle Gravdal,\\r\\naccording to which his death was sudden, being stricken as he was\\r\\nat work. The notice says, \"he was one of those who had tried the\\r\\nprivations and the trials of pioneer life, and he was always ready\\r\\nto extend a helping hand to all who needed it. He enjoyed universal\\r\\nrespect and love for his sincerity and his integrity and his lovable\\r\\nnature.\" Sarah Gravdal, daughter of Gullik Gravdal, married Halvor\\r\\nHalvorson (son of Cleophas Halvorson), of Newark Township, in 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nHellik Nilson Brække married a sister of Reverend C. F. Clausen\\'s\\r\\nwife; in 1852 he joined the latter\\'s colony of settlers in Mitchell\\r\\nCounty, Iowa. Lars Skavlem was born in 1819. He married Groe Nilson\\r\\nAas in 1844; their children are Halvor, Bessie, Helen and Carolina.\\r\\nThe son, Halvor L. Skavlem, born 1848, is a farmer in Newark Township;\\r\\nhe married Cornelia Olmstead, in Plymouth, a granddaughter of Mrs.\\r\\nGunild Ödegaarden.[96] Gunnul Stordok moved to Rock Run (see below). It\\r\\nseems that he had retained some of his land in Newark, for when Gunder\\r\\nKnudson Springen (brother of Gullik Springen) came there in 1843, he\\r\\nbought land then owned by Gunnul Stordok.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [96] They have two children, Lulu and Lewis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now leave, for the present, the Rock Prairie Settlement, and\\r\\nobserve what was taking place elsewhere during the period that has been\\r\\nbriefly sketched here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n             _The Rock Run Settlement. Other Immigrants of\\r\\n                    1839. The Immigration of 1840._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been stated that a settlement was also established in Illinois\\r\\nabout twenty miles southwest of Rock Prairie, the same year as the\\r\\nlatter was settled, _i. e._, in 1839. This came to be known as the\\r\\nRock Run Settlement, from the name of the town. It lies partly in\\r\\nStephenson, partly in Winnebago County. The locality is prairie,\\r\\nrelieved here and there by bits of timber land. The foundation of this\\r\\nsettlement is also to be accredited to an immigrant from Numedal,\\r\\nwho came on the _Amelia_, in 1839. His name was Clemet Torstenson\\r\\nStabæk, and he came from Rollaug Parish. With him three others located\\r\\nthere in the fall of 1839, namely, Syvert Tollefson and Ole Anderson,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, and a Mr. Knudson, from Drammen. Stabæk was a man of\\r\\nconsiderable means. He selected land in Winnebago County, near the\\r\\npresent village of Davis. His son, Torsten K. O. Stabæk (born in\\r\\nNorway[97]) married Torgen Patterson, and they lived on the farm until\\r\\n1884, when they moved to Davis.[98] Kristopher Rostad and wife, Kristi,\\r\\nseem also to have moved to Rock Run before the close of 1839. In the\\r\\nfollowing summer came Gunnul Stordok, to whom we have referred under\\r\\nthe settling of Newark in Rock County. Stordok lived in Rock Run until\\r\\n1870; he then moved back to Newark, where the rest of his relatives\\r\\nwho had come to America had settled.[99] Gunnul Stordok was born in\\r\\nRollaug, Numedal, in the year 1800; he married Mary Larson (of Rollaug)\\r\\nbefore emigrating.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [97] Not on the homestead, as _History of Norwegians of Illinois_,\\r\\n       page 487, has it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [98] In 1895 he organized the Farmers Bank of Davis, Illinois, of\\r\\n       which his son, C. O. R. Stabeck, is now cashier.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [99] When he returned to Newark in 1870 he bought two hundred acres\\r\\n       of land, for which he paid seven thousand dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest arrivals in the settlement subsequently was Halvor\\r\\nAasen, born in Numedal in 1823, and who came to America in 1841. For\\r\\ntwo years after coming to this country he worked in the lead mines at\\r\\nMineral Point, Wisconsin, and at Galena, Illinois. In 1843 he married\\r\\nChristie Olson, and bought a farm in Laona Township, Winnebago County,\\r\\nwhither he and his wife moved in 1844. Here they lived until their\\r\\ndeath. She died in 1902, and he in March, 1905.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [100] Their children are Ole Anderson and Andrew Anderson at Davis,\\r\\n        Illinois, and Mrs. O. H. Lerud at Lyle, Minnesota; four\\r\\n        children are dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock Run Settlement was prosperous but did not grow to such\\r\\nproportions as its sister settlements to the north. In later years many\\r\\nof its earlier pioneers moved back to Rock County, as Stordok did,\\r\\nand as Lars Rostad and family also did in the sixties. Among those\\r\\nwho located at Rock Run in the forties were Hovel Paulson (born 1817)\\r\\nfrom North Land Parish, Norway, who located near Davis in 1846;[101]\\r\\nChristian Lunde, also from Land, Norway, came to Rock Run in 1848 and\\r\\nlater moved to Goodhue County, Minnesota; Narve Stabæk, Torsten Knudson\\r\\nand Nels Nelson, all three from Numedal; Gunder O. Halvorson, from\\r\\nKragerö; Svale Nilson, from Bukn Parish, Stavanger; Gunder Halvorson,\\r\\nfrom Telemarken, and Lars O. Anderson. There appears a very brief\\r\\naccount of the Rock Run Settlement by Lars O. Anderson in _Nordlyset_,\\r\\nunder date of June second, 1848. According to this there were at that\\r\\ntime twenty families, twelve unmarried men over twenty years of age,\\r\\nsix unmarried women of over twenty years, while there were thirty-two\\r\\npersons below the age of twenty. The whole settlement, he says, numbers\\r\\nninety persons and comprises 4,062 acres of land.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [101] He moved to the Old People\\'s Home in Stoughton in 1903, where\\r\\n        he died in 1907, his wife having died in 1905. His only son\\r\\n        was killed in the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have followed somewhat fully the immigration movement in Numedal\\r\\nand Telemarken in 1839, and we have also noted the fact that that year\\r\\nrecords its contingent of emigrants also from Stavanger Province.\\r\\nIt remains here to note briefly the growth of the movement in Voss\\r\\nand its spread elsewhere. Nils Lydvo came from Voss in 1839, and\\r\\nwent directly to his brothers, Knud and Ole Lydvo, in Shelby County,\\r\\nMissouri. At the same time came Anders Finno, Lars Davidson Rekve, Nils\\r\\nSeverson Gilderhus, and Anfin Leidal; their destination was La Salle\\r\\nCounty.[102] The party further contained Ole K. Gilderhus, Lars Ygre,\\r\\nAnders Flage, Lars Dugstad, Knud Gjöstein, Anders Nilson Brække and\\r\\nwife, Knud Brække and wife, Magne B. Bystölen, Anna Gilderhus, and Anna\\r\\nBakketun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis party seems to have arrived in New York early in July, 1839, and\\r\\nto have intended to go to Illinois. We shall meet with most of them\\r\\nlater as pioneers in Wisconsin settlements, but for a time many of them\\r\\nremained in Chicago, so that in the fall of 1839 and the following\\r\\nwinter there was a considerable colony of Norwegian immigrants located\\r\\nin Chicago. Nils A. Lie, of Deerfield, Wisconsin, writing of this\\r\\nfact, says there were more Vossings in Chicago about 1840 than all\\r\\nother Norwegians combined.[103] Among those who remained temporarily\\r\\nin Chicago were Ole K. Gilderhus, Lars Ygre and Lars Rekve. The last\\r\\nof these worked for a year on a steamer plying between Chicago and St.\\r\\nJoseph, Michigan.[104] I shall give a brief sketch of him below, under\\r\\n_Koshkonong_. Anders Finno went to Koshkonong, Dane County, in 1840,\\r\\nbut later settled in Blue Mounds, in the same county. In 1850 he went\\r\\nto California with a group of gold seekers and has not since been heard\\r\\nfrom by his compatriots.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [102] Where, however, they did not remain, as we shall see.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [103] _Bygdejaevning_, page 43.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [104] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 330.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnders Nilson Brække[105] was born at Brække, Voss, Norway, February\\r\\ntwelfth, 1818; he had married Inger Nelson in Norway. Brække located\\r\\npermanently in Chicago, working at first for Mathew Laflin and John\\r\\nWright. He laid the foundation of his future fortune in 1845, when he\\r\\npurchased some property on Superior Street, on part of which he built\\r\\nthe residence, where he lived until his death in 1887. He held many\\r\\noffices of public trust in the discharge of which he was able and\\r\\nunimpeachable in his honesty. Brække\\'s first wife died early leaving\\r\\nthree children.[106] In 1849 he married Mrs. Julia K. Williams; three\\r\\nchildren by this marriage are living.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [105] Andrew Nelson Brekke.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [106] They are all dead long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [107] A daughter of theirs is Mrs. J. A. Waite of the Anchor Line\\r\\n        Steamship Company. I am indebted to Strand\\'s _Norwegians\\r\\n        in Illinois_ (page 215) for some of the facts of Brække\\'s\\r\\n        personal history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the party of emigrants from Voss in 1839 were also Arne Anderson\\r\\nVinje (born 1820) and wife Martha (Gulliksdatter Kindem). From Vinje we\\r\\nlearn that the ship, on which the twenty emigrants from Voss came that\\r\\nyear, left Norway April sixteenth and that they arrived at Chicago in\\r\\nSeptember. Vinje located first in Chicago; soon after arriving he built\\r\\na log house, in which he and his wife lived during the first winter.\\r\\nAnders Brække, it is said, assisted him in the erection of the log\\r\\nhouse. During the winter Vinje worked on a road that was being laid out\\r\\non the west side; for this work he received sixteen dollars a month.\\r\\nThe next July however Vinje together with Per Davidson Skjerveim (who\\r\\nhad just arrived from Voss, Norway) each with his team of oxen left for\\r\\nHamilton Diggings in La Fayette. Here each took a claim of government\\r\\nland; of this we shall speak more at length in the chapter on Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1840 emigration from Norway was rather limited. There\\r\\nhad been a considerable exodus in 1839 from Numedal and Telemarken. The\\r\\nlull in 1840 may be explained by the fact that intending emigrants in\\r\\nthose regions were waiting for favorable news from their relatives and\\r\\nfriends who had gone the preceding year. The settlers at Muskego, on\\r\\nJefferson and Rock Prairies and at Rock Run had barely gotten located\\r\\nwhen the winter set in. Communication was of course very slow, and\\r\\nspring and early summer was the sailing season of Norwegian emigrants\\r\\nin those days. The year 1840, however, brought its quota of arrivals\\r\\nfrom Voss,[108] namely Kund J. Hylle, Ole S. Gilderhus, Knut Rokne,\\r\\nMads Sanve, Baard Nyre, Brynjolf Ronve, Torstein Saue, wife, and son\\r\\nGulleik,[109] Klaus Grimestad and wife, Arne Urland and wife, and Lars\\r\\nT. Röthe; there were twenty in all in the party. All of these it is\\r\\nsaid settled in Chicago.[110] They all came in Captain Ankerson\\'s ship\\r\\n_Emelia_, the same ship which carried Nattestad\\'s party in 1839. They\\r\\nwere five months on this journey, arriving in Chicago in September. We\\r\\nshall later meet with some of these elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [108] As also from Drammen, see below, page 159.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [109] Father of Torger G. Thompson of Cambridge, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [110] I gather most of these names from Nils A. Lie\\'s account in\\r\\n        _Bygdejaevning_, pages 47-48.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other names from different parts of Norway are recorded among\\r\\nthe immigrants of 1839. We have observed above that Johan Nordboe of\\r\\nRingebo in Gudbrandsdalen had come to America in 1832. Though he wrote\\r\\nletters home it does not seem that he succeeded in promoting emigration\\r\\nfrom that section of Norway, except individually, and then not until\\r\\n1839. In that year his friend Lars Johanneson Holo of Ringsaker,\\r\\nHedemarken, together with three grown up sons came to America.[111]\\r\\nHolo did, however, not go to Dallas County, Texas, where Nordboe had\\r\\nsettled the year before, but he first located in Rochester, New York. A\\r\\nman by the name of Lauman from Faaberg in Gudbrandsdalen also came with\\r\\nhim and went to Rochester. He, however, went west a few years later,\\r\\nsettling in Lee County, Illinois. Holo remained in Rochester two years,\\r\\nhe and his sons being employed there on the canal. In 1841 they went to\\r\\nMuskego, where we shall find them in our next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [111] The route led by way of Havre and New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1839 we find one man from Sogn, the first to\\r\\nemigrate from that region to America. His name is Per I. Unde,[112] and\\r\\nhe came from Vik Parish in Outer Sogn. He lived in Chicago it seems,\\r\\nthe two first years he was in America. In 1841 his brother Ole Unde\\r\\narrived and the two went to La Fayette County; we shall speak of both\\r\\nof these men later. Among the immigrants of 1839 who did not go to\\r\\nMuskego I may here mention Knud Hellikson Roe and wife Anna and four\\r\\nchildren who came from Tin, Telemarken. They went to La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, where they lived till 1841; thence they removed to Racine\\r\\nCounty and in 1843 went to Dane County, Wisconsin (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [112] H. R. Holand writes of Per Unde in _Skandinaven_ for July\\r\\n        seventeenth, 1908, stating that he came in 1842. Unde\\'s\\r\\n        nephew, Jacob Unde of Sherry, Wisconsin, contributes in a\\r\\n        later issue of _Skandinaven_ some corrections, among them\\r\\n        that Per Unde came in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle H. Hanson and wife also from Tin, Telemarken, came in 1839. They\\r\\nsettled at Indian Creek, near where now stands the village of Leland,\\r\\nLa Salle County, Illinois. The first winter they lived in a dugout on\\r\\nthe same spot on the homestead where the residence now stands. Mrs.\\r\\nHanson died in 1842, Mr. Hanson died three years later. The children\\r\\nwere Ole, known as Ole H. Hanson, Alex, Betsey, Helen, and Levina.\\r\\nOle Hanson assumed charge of the homestead and lived there and near\\r\\nLeland till his death in December, 1904. In 1855 he married Isabella\\r\\nOsmundson, who died in 1873. They had six children, one of whom is C.\\r\\nF. Hanson,[113] State\\'s Attorney, of Morris, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [113] To whom I am indebted chiefly for the family history. Alex\\r\\n        Hanson lives at Ellsworth, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Settlement of Norway and Raymond Townships,\\r\\n                     Racine County. The Founders of\\r\\n                     the Settlement. Immigration to\\r\\n                      Racine County in 1841-1842._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen how in the fall of 1839 the Luraas brothers established\\r\\na colony near Lake Muskego in the present Waukesha (then Milwaukee)\\r\\nCounty. The locality was illy selected, being low and marshy. It was in\\r\\nthe first place unhealthy and the settlers suffered much from malaria.\\r\\nFurthermore it was very heavily covered with timber and the soil which\\r\\nwas clay yielded but small returns for their labor. The settlers\\r\\ntherefore found it difficult enough to make a living.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as the next spring several moved farther south into Racine\\r\\nCounty, where the conditions were more favorable and where a thriving\\r\\nsettlement grew up in a few years. The old settlement ceased to become\\r\\nthe objective point of intending emigrants from Telemarken. After the\\r\\ncholera year 1849 most of those who survived moved away.[114] The\\r\\nsouthern extension of the settlement, which took its root at Wind Lake\\r\\nin Norway Township, later spread out so as to include the townships\\r\\nof Yorkville, Raymond and Waterford all in Racine County. The old\\r\\nname, \"Muskego,\" was retained as the designation of the new as well as\\r\\nthe old settlement, although the settlement in Racine County is now\\r\\noften referred to as \"Yorkville Prairie.\" It is the beginnings of this\\r\\nsettlement to which I shall now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [114] The editor of _Billed-Magazin_ writes, page eleven of volume\\r\\n        I, that at that time (1869) Kittil Lohner and his brother\\r\\n        Halvor Nilson Lohner, from Hjertdal, Telemarken, and the\\r\\n        family of Gisle Danielson, from Skjold, were still living in\\r\\n        the settlement. The rest were dead or had moved away. But\\r\\n        Knud J. Bæckhus, from Hjertdal, and Ole Kjonaas, from Bö, had\\r\\n        settled west of the colony in the town of Vernon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founders of the settlement at Wind Lake in the Town of Norway\\r\\nwere Sören Backe, son of Tolleff O. Backe a merchant of Drammen, and\\r\\nJohannes Johanneson. The latter was a clerk in the employ of Tollef\\r\\nBacke of Drammen, whom he latter deputed to accompany his son to\\r\\nAmerica. He was a man of about forty years of age, of strong character\\r\\nand moral principles. He had some knowledge of the English language,\\r\\nhaving once lived for a short time in England. Sören Backe was a young\\r\\nman, evidently of little promise, whom the father sent to America\\r\\nostensibly that his ambition might be kindled by American opportunities\\r\\nand by being placed upon his own responsibility. In company with them\\r\\ncame also a third man, of whom I shall speak again in a later chapter,\\r\\nnamely Elling Eielson Sunve from Voss, a lay preacher and the noted\\r\\nfounder of the \"Ellingian\" sect of the Lutheran Church. These three\\r\\nleft Drammen in the summer of 1839, and arrived in La Salle County in\\r\\nthe fall of that year. The forest land had all been taken and was now\\r\\noccupied by settlers, and Johannesen seems to have been suspicious of\\r\\nthe prairie, where land could still be had.\\r\\n\\r\\nA contributor to the _Billed-Magazin_ for 1869 says that the conditions\\r\\nof distress, the winter storms and the extreme cold on the prairies\\r\\nwere the things that influenced them to seek a locality for a\\r\\nsettlement elsewhere, and that they did not go north to Racine County\\r\\nuntil the spring of 1840. He says: \"Early the next spring they walked\\r\\nnorth and came as far as to Wind Lake, where there was then a single\\r\\nsettler, an Irishman. Here in the primeval forest, on the shores of the\\r\\nlittle lake they had found what their hearts desired; and they bought\\r\\nthe piece of ground which the Irishman was cultivating, and Backe chose\\r\\nthis place as his home.\" It is to be noted, however, that K. Langeland\\r\\nin _Nordmaendene i Amerika_ says that they remained in La Salle County\\r\\nonly a few weeks and went north to Wisconsin that same fall (page\\r\\nforty-three).[115] Langeland adds further, that they dug a cellar in an\\r\\nIndian mound in which they lived during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [115] Professor Anderson accepts unreservedly the authority of\\r\\n        _Billed-Magazin_ in the matter and decides for the date 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn touching upon these facts in my article on \"The Coming of the\\r\\nNorwegians to Iowa\"[116] I did not hesitate to accept this as correct,\\r\\nand I must now adhere to this view. My reason is that as early as the\\r\\nmiddle of the summer of 1840 a small group of emigrants were ready\\r\\nto leave for America with the view of settling at Wind Lake, having\\r\\nreceived letters from Backe and Johannesen, urging them to come there.\\r\\nHad these not located at Wind Lake before the spring of 1840 the time\\r\\nwould have been insufficient for the second party at Drammen to have\\r\\nnot only received word from America but also to have made all necessary\\r\\narrangements preparatory to emigrating. I assume then that it was about\\r\\nDecember 1839 that Backe and Johannesen located in Norway Township. I\\r\\nam inclined to think, however, that Elling Eielson remained in the Fox\\r\\nRiver Settlement during the winter, and that he came to Wind Lake in\\r\\nthe spring of 1840. During that spring and summer the brothers John,\\r\\nTorger, Halvor, and Knut Luraas, with their families, as also Gjermund\\r\\nJohnson Kaasa, located in Norway Township. Nelson Johnson Kaasa, who\\r\\nhad emigrated in the Luraas party in 1839, remained in Milwaukee for\\r\\nthree months and moved to the settlement in November, 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [116] In _The Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, 1905, page 360.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants of 1837, who went to the ill-fated Beaver Creek\\r\\nSettlement in Iroquois County, Illinois, was Mons K. Aadland. We have\\r\\nalready observed that he was the last one to leave Beaver Creek. He\\r\\nwith family also came to Racine County in the summer of 1840. He\\r\\nhowever selected a locality on the prairie east of the Indian mound,\\r\\nbuying a farm of a hundred and sixty acres on section thirty in\\r\\nRaymond Township. This part of the settlement came to be known as North\\r\\nCape. The nucleus of the later extensive settlement had then assumed\\r\\nconsiderable proportions by the fall of 1840; but new accessions were\\r\\nsoon to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacke and Johannesen decided to write to friends in Norway and their\\r\\nletters were productive of results. In the summer of 1840 a party of\\r\\nabout thirty persons stood ready to emigrate to the settlement in\\r\\nWisconsin. The leader of these was Even Hanson Heg, the keeper of a\\r\\nhotel at Lier in Drammen, who sold out his property and with his wife\\r\\nand four children came with this party. Other members of the party\\r\\nwere: Johannes Evenson Skofstad, Syvert Ingebretson Narverud, Helge\\r\\nThomson, Ole Anderson, all from Drammen and all of whom had families,\\r\\nOle Hogenson and family from Eggedal, and Knut Aslakson Svalestuen from\\r\\nVinje, Telemarken. All these came to Wind Lake and located there in the\\r\\nautumn of 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nSören Backe seems to have been a man whose generosity was as remarkable\\r\\nas his lack of business ability. His father, a man of considerable\\r\\nwealth, had supplied his son generously with funds upon his departure\\r\\nfor America. Sören Backe evidently loaned money very liberally to\\r\\nthose of his countrymen who were in need, and there were many of these\\r\\nhere as in all pioneer communities. It is said that when his funds\\r\\nwere used up he made a journey to Norway for more money. With this he\\r\\npurchased land, which he let out on easy terms to new comers from\\r\\nNorway. It was Johannesen who had charge of these transactions in which\\r\\nit seems Even Heg was a partner with Backe. Johannesen is described as\\r\\na devout christian, a zealous adherent of the Haugian tendency, and in\\r\\nevery way a noble character. As we have seen, the settlement developed\\r\\nrapidly, and it continued to grow for many years. Backe and Johannesen\\r\\nthen joined partnership and started a store; for this purpose an\\r\\nIndian mound was excavated, the walls were sided with boards, and this\\r\\nstructure, which was partly underground, served as store, living room\\r\\nand kitchen combined. Their stock of goods was shipped from Milwaukee,\\r\\nitself then only a village of one or two stores, a hotel and half a\\r\\ndozen pioneer cabins. Backe and Johannesen continued their business\\r\\ntogether for about three years when Johannesen fell ill and died (in\\r\\n1845). That same year Backe returned to Norway and settled on his\\r\\nfather\\'s farm Valle, in Lier, near Drammen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Heg was a leading spirit in the settlement in Norway and\\r\\nsurrounding townships during his life-time. Much has been written\\r\\nabout him and I shall not here repeat the eulogies elsewhere voiced\\r\\nin his honor. After Johannesen\\'s death it was Heg upon whom the\\r\\nsettlers in the early days of the colony leaned for advice and it was\\r\\nEven Heg to whom every new arrival from Norway to the colony came for\\r\\nhelp and counsel. His hospitality and his resourcefulness in the aid\\r\\nof his compatriots was boundless. Heg\\'s barn, where large parties\\r\\nof immigrants were received every summer, and in which they were\\r\\npermitted freely to make their home during the first weeks after the\\r\\nlong and arduous journey, is famed throughout many an early settlement\\r\\nin Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. The log cabins of the settlers\\r\\nwere too small to afford the necessary quarters for the numbers that\\r\\ncontinuously flocked in, and the large barn was a boon for which they\\r\\nwere truly grateful. For a time Racine County became the objective\\r\\npoint of most of the immigrants from Norway, a distinction which\\r\\nhowever it was soon to share with the still more famous Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie in Dane County, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Elling Eielson I shall speak below, as also of Hans C. Heg, son\\r\\nof Even Heg, and of some of the other Racine County pioneers. I wish\\r\\nto add here a few words of Mons Aadland, who as we recall, came to\\r\\nAmerica in 1837, and located at North Cape in 1840. Aadland was born\\r\\nnear Bergen, Norway, in April, 1793, being thus forty-four years old\\r\\nwhen he emigrated. He was one of the few survivors of the Beaver Creek\\r\\nColony in Illinois. As we have seen, he is the founder of the North\\r\\nCape branch of the settlement. There he lived till his death in 1869,\\r\\nhis wife having died two years before. A settlers\\' history says of him:\\r\\n\"He was a man of generous spirit, as is shown by his liberal gifts,\\r\\nand one who took a commendable interest in public affairs.\" Ten years\\r\\nbefore his death he owned between five and six hundred acres of land\\r\\nwhich he then divided among his children. Thomas Adland and Knud Adland\\r\\nboth of Raymond Township are his sons, while a daughter, Martha, lives\\r\\nin Norway; the other children are dead.[117] Mons Aadland was a nephew\\r\\nof Nils P. Langeland whom we have spoken of above page 100.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [117] Mons Aadland had a sister Malinda, the wife of Anders\\r\\n        Nordvig, who came to America in the same ship as he. Anders\\r\\n        Nordvig died in Beaver Creek. His wife moved to the Fox River\\r\\n        Settlement, where she died, ninety years old, about 1892. I\\r\\n        have above written the name Adland as it came to be written\\r\\n        in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigration of 1841 was not extensive. Backe and Johannesen do not\\r\\nseem to have continued their propaganda of immigration; but the party\\r\\nwho came with Even Heg wrote home letters full of praise of the New\\r\\nWorld. But even in the face of such tempting exhortations the old world\\r\\nresident requires time for thought before he decides to bid farewell to\\r\\nthe home of his fathers and seek his fortune in a strange and distant\\r\\nland. I am not aware that anyone came from Drammen or Telemarken to\\r\\nRacine County in 1841.[118] Knut Roe and wife located in Racine County,\\r\\nhowever, in 1841, but they came from La Salle County, where they had\\r\\nsettled in 1839. In 1842 there were several arrivals. Thus Hermund\\r\\nNilson Tufte with wife Kari and three daughters came from Aal Parish in\\r\\nHallingdal. This was the first family to emigrate to America from that\\r\\nprovince.[119] In that year came also Aanund Halvorson Bjoin, wife and\\r\\nfamily from Tin, Telemarken, and John Jacobson; further, Halvor Larson\\r\\nLysenstöen (Modum) from Hadeland, Norway, the first immigrant from that\\r\\nregion, and Helge Sigurdson and wife Bergit Olsdatter, who however,\\r\\nremoved to Dane County in 1844.[120] John J. Dale from Norway, who\\r\\nhad come to America in 1837 and settled in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\ncame to Racine in 1842; his wife Anna had died in Illinois in 1839.\\r\\nAnother of the immigrants of 1839 came to Muskego in 1842, namely John\\r\\nEvenson Molee. He had lived in Milwaukee the preceding three years; I\\r\\nshall speak of him below. There were individual accessions to other\\r\\nsettlements in 1841-42, but they are few in number. With 1843 the\\r\\nimmigration movement receives a new impulse, but the discussion of that\\r\\nyear will better be postponed until we have recorded the founding of\\r\\nsome other important settlements in 1840-42.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [118] Nor any from other provinces, for Hermund Tufte who, in\\r\\n        Holand\\'s _De norske Settlementers Historie_, is said to have\\r\\n        come in 1841, did not come before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [119] See below under Rock Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [120] The _Biographical Review of Dane County, Wisconsin_, 1893,\\r\\n        page 239, gives 1842 as the year Seamon A. Seamonson came\\r\\n        from Skien, Norway, to Racine County, his wife and three\\r\\n        children coming the next year (see later chapter).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Establishment of the Koshkonong Settlement\\r\\n                      in Dane County, Wisconsin_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genesis of the settlement of Koshkonong Prairie[121] in Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, the most noted undoubtedly of all Norwegian\\r\\nsettlements in America, dates from 1840. The recital of this event,\\r\\nhowever, will take us back to the preceding year; for the first visit\\r\\nof Norwegians to Dane County, is, I believe, correctly recorded as\\r\\nhaving taken place in 1839. Before discussing the first coming of Norse\\r\\npioneers to Koshkonong I shall mention a few \"first settlers\" in Dane\\r\\nCounty, who preceded the Norwegians; to do this will help to give us\\r\\na better idea of the state of wilderness which they found there, and\\r\\nwhich they in a few years transformed into a settled and thriving\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [121] In reality a group of prairies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe townships in Dane County in which the Norwegians settled most\\r\\nextensively are found in three groups, viz.: in the southeastern, in\\r\\nthe northern and in the southwestern part of the county. The first\\r\\nof these comprises originally Albion, Christiana and Deerfield; from\\r\\nthis region the settlement soon grew into Dunkirk and Pleasant Spring,\\r\\nand from the latter north into Cottage Grove.[122] On the east it\\r\\nextends into Sumner and Oakland townships in Jefferson County. This\\r\\nsettlement came to be known as Koshkonong Prairie, though properly\\r\\nthe name applies only to the two first-named towns and adjacent\\r\\nportions of Pleasant Spring and Deerfield. The second settlement\\r\\nincludes the townships of Burke, eastern Westport, Vienna, Windsor,\\r\\nand northwestern and central Bristol. The western portion of this\\r\\nsettlement is generally known by the name of the Norway (or Norwegian)\\r\\nGrove Settlement, from the post-office of that name in Vienna Township\\r\\naround which it lies. In its northern extremity the settlement extends\\r\\ninto Columbia County, northeast into Spring Prairie and Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nand northwest past the village of Lodi. This whole region is in reality\\r\\na northern extension of the Koshkonong Settlement.[123] It is also from\\r\\nfour to eight years later in order of formation.[124] Our third group\\r\\nof townships comprises Primrose, Perry, Springdale, Blue Mound and that\\r\\npart of Verona Township which lies east of Blue Mound Creek.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [122] Later Norwegians settled also in Blooming Grove (west of\\r\\n        Cottage Grove) and in Rutland (west of Dunkirk), but they\\r\\n        always remained here a minority of the population. On the\\r\\n        north the settlement extends also into southeastern Sun\\r\\n        Prairie and southwestern Medina.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [123] But Spring Prairie was settled slightly earlier than Norway\\r\\n        Grove.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [124] The settlement enters the Town of Dane (northwestern part) on\\r\\n        the west.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [125] That is, excluding the southwestern part of the town and\\r\\n        sections 6, 7, and 18 along its western line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Town of Albion the Norwegians were the earliest settlers, for\\r\\nsome of them came as early as the spring of 1841, as we shall see\\r\\nbelow. The _History of Dane County_, 1880,[126] says, page 838, that\\r\\nFreeborn Sweet, from New York, was the first settler in the town; and\\r\\nyet on page 1189 we are told that he was \"one of the first settlers.\"\\r\\nAs he did not arrive until August of that year he clearly was not the\\r\\nfirst. The next earliest American settler seems to have been Samuel\\r\\nT. Stewart of Massachusetts, who located on section fourteen in the\\r\\nfall of 1841.[127] The first white settler in the Town of Christiana\\r\\nwas William M. Mayhew who came in 1837, and located on section\\r\\ntwenty-eight. The next arrivals were Norwegians (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [126] A work which, unfortunately, contains a great many errors.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [127] In the spring of 1842 Duty J. Green and Jesse Saunders came,\\r\\n        both from Alleghany County, New York; they settled near\\r\\n        Saunders\\' Creek, where Albion village now stands. Saunders\\r\\n        had lived one year in Rock County. In 1842 also, Samuel\\r\\n        Clarke of Yorkshire, England, son of James and Judith A.\\r\\n        Clarke, arrived, and located on Albion Prairie. John S.\\r\\n        Bullis, Giles Eggleston, Lorenzo Coon, and Barton Edwards,\\r\\n        came in 1842, C. R. Head in 1843, as also Adin Burdick, and\\r\\n        in 1844 Job Bunting, L. O. Humphrey, R. P. Humphrey, Henry\\r\\n        Job, Samuel Marsden, and James Wileman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first settler in Pleasant Spring seems to have been Abel Rasdall,\\r\\nwho located his cabin on the eastern shore of Lake Kegonsa, about half\\r\\na mile south of the inlet; the year of his arrival, however, cannot\\r\\nbe given definitely and I am not able to say with certainty whether\\r\\nhe preceded Knut H. Roe (see below) or not. In the Town of Deerfield\\r\\nthe first settlement was made by Norwegians in 1840; as we shall show\\r\\nbelow; however, Philip Kearney had erected a house on section eighteen\\r\\nin 1839; he remained the only American there for several years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first settlers in the Town of Rutland were Joseph Dejean, John\\r\\nPrentice and Dan Pond, who located in its southern part in 1842. John\\r\\nNelson Luraas may have been the first settler in Dunkirk; he came in\\r\\n1843, and was followed soon after by John Wheeler,[128] Chauncey Isham,\\r\\nand Mitchel Campbell. In the towns of Cottage Grove, Burke, Windsor,\\r\\nand Bristol, Americans preceded Norwegians by several years, as also in\\r\\nBlue Mounds, where Ebenezer Brigham located as early as 1828, or some\\r\\nsixteen years before that part of the county actually became settled.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [128] From whom Wheeler Prairie takes its name. I am inclined to\\r\\n        think that Wheeler preceded Luraas (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Township of Springdale was settled first in 1844, when John Harlow\\r\\nentered it, he remaining the only white man there for a year. A few\\r\\nAmericans came in 1845, then Americans and Norwegian immigrants in\\r\\n1846. An American settlement was effected by Thomas Lindsay and David\\r\\nRobertson in the Town of Bristol (section seven) two years before\\r\\nNorwegians came there, which was in 1847. The earliest settler,\\r\\nhowever, seems to be William G. Simons who entered in 1838. The first\\r\\nwhite settler in Perry Township was John Brown of Indiana, who came\\r\\ninto the town in 1846. A few other Americans (as B. K. Berry in 1847)\\r\\npreceded the Norwegians, whose coming dates from 1848. In the Town of\\r\\nPrimrose, Robert Spears and family were the first comers (1844); a few\\r\\nother Americans had also arrived there before Christian Hendrickson\\r\\nlocated in the town in 1846. We shall now turn to the events that\\r\\nled to the establishment of the extensive Norwegian settlement on\\r\\nKoshkonong Prairie in the southeastern part of the county.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that most of the immigrants from Voss, Norway, who came\\r\\nin 1839, located either in Chicago or in La Salle County, Illinois. It\\r\\nhas been observed also that not all of those who went to the Fox River\\r\\nregion located there permanently. The land here was now mostly taken,\\r\\nbesides our pioneers from Voss did not like the prairie; they were in\\r\\nsearch of a location where timber and water was near at hand. And so\\r\\nsome of them decided to try their fortune in Wisconsin, where they had\\r\\nheard there was plenty of forest land with many lakes and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur party from Voss had been in La Salle County only a few weeks, when\\r\\nthree of them decided to go and investigate for themselves. These three\\r\\nwere Nils Bolstad, Nils Gilderhus and Magne Bystölen. They engaged\\r\\nOdd J. Himle (who had emigrated from Voss in 1837), then living in\\r\\nIllinois, to accompany them as their guide and interpreter. Bystölen,\\r\\nbeing taken sick and thus prevented from going, gave instructions to\\r\\nthe rest to select land for him if the region was satisfactory to the\\r\\nrest. Bolstad, Gilderhus and Himle started on foot for Milwaukee, a\\r\\ndistance of a hundred and fifty miles. Having arrived there in safety,\\r\\nthey procured maps and whatever information they could with reference\\r\\nto the regions that were open to settlement in the interior of the\\r\\nstate. Then they walked west about eighty miles inspecting the land on\\r\\nthe way, and after two weeks reached the eastern part of Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spot where they stopped was about two miles east of the site of\\r\\nthe present village of Cambridge. Here a man by the name of Snell had\\r\\nshortly before established a tavern for trappers and frontiersmen;\\r\\nwith him our party of homeseekers put up, and from him they received\\r\\ninstructions as to the \"government markings\" of the sections and the\\r\\nstakes placed at the corner of sections and quarter sections, giving\\r\\nthe number of each.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a two days\\' rest they continued their tramp westward to\\r\\nKoshkonong[129] Prairie. Himle, Gilderhus and Bolstad inspected the\\r\\nwhole prairie from one end to the other, walking about for two days.\\r\\nThen they returned to Cambridge, finally deciding on a parcel of land\\r\\na little over two miles northwest of that place, lying on both sides\\r\\nof the boundary line between the towns of Christiana and Deerfield.\\r\\nHere Gilderhus and Bolstad selected forty acres each, and forty for\\r\\nBystölen. This locality was chosen because of its abundance of hardwood\\r\\ntimber, and besides there was plenty of hay on the marshes and fine\\r\\nfishing in Koshkonong Creek near by.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [129] The prairie takes its name from Koshkonong Creek (and\\r\\n        Koshkonong Lake).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [130] As Mr. Odland points out. Odland adds: \"They were all Vossings\\r\\n        and to emigrants from that celebrated district in Norway,\\r\\n        therefore, belongs the credit of founding the most important\\r\\n        Norwegian settlement in America.\" (Article in _Amerika_).\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus made their choice of land, Gilderhus, Bolstad, and Himle\\r\\nreturned to Illinois by way of Milwaukee, walking the whole distance;\\r\\nthey remained in La Salle County through the winter. Their account of\\r\\nthe land of promise which they had discovered, aroused much interest,\\r\\nand, as we shall see below, brought others in their train later. Early\\r\\nin the spring of 1840, Gilderhus and Bolstad, accompanied now by Magne\\r\\nBystölen and also Andrew Finno, started for Koshkonong, driving,\\r\\nthis time, in wagons drawn by oxen. They arrived there at the end of\\r\\nApril and immediately took possession of the land selected. The land\\r\\nthat had been chosen for Bystölen was inside the Christiana Township\\r\\nline, where Anders Finno also now located. Nils Gilderhus\\'s land\\r\\nlay within Deerfield Township; he was the first Norwegian to locate\\r\\nthere. He built a log cabin, which was the first house in the town.\\r\\nNils Gilderhus and, I believe, Nils Bolstad, soon after walked to\\r\\nMilwaukee and filed their claims at the government land office, Nils\\r\\nGilderhus being the first in the party to purchase land. The date of\\r\\nthe purchase is May sixth, 1840; the land is the south half of the\\r\\nsouthwest quarter of section thirty-five. Nils Bolstad entered on forty\\r\\nacres of section two in the Town of Christiana, and Magne Bystölen\\'s\\r\\nforty acres lay directly east of Bolstad\\'s in the same section.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [131] Their names are recorded in the land office as Nils Seaverson,\\r\\n        Nils Larson and Magany Buttelson.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first habitation was a hurriedly built log cabin; it was not\\r\\nplastered, and, as we can believe, proved inadequate as a protection\\r\\nagainst winter, which was already setting in. Here they experienced\\r\\nthe intensest suffering from cold,[132] until, the condition becoming\\r\\nintolerable, they dug out a cellar against an embankment, where they\\r\\nlived during the remainder of the cold season. In this \"dugout\" Nils\\r\\nGilderhus and Magne Bystölen continued to live another year, but Nils\\r\\nBolstad erected a log cabin in 1841, when he married Anna Vindeig, who\\r\\nwas the first white woman in the locality. Gilderhus erected a cabin in\\r\\nthe town of Deerfield near the Christiana line in 1842, but he sold out\\r\\nin 1843 to Gulleik Thompson Saue; for further facts about these men see\\r\\nbelow. Andrew Fenno and Odd Himle did not purchase land.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [132] Odland writes: when they had finished their work outside,\\r\\n        they were obliged to lie down on their beds and cover up with\\r\\n        robes in order not to freeze.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [133] Himle settled some years later at Norway Grove, Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now turn to the two other groups of settlers on Koshkonong in\\r\\n1840.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n             _The Settling of Koshkonong by Immigrants from\\r\\n                  Numedal and Stavanger in 1840. Other\\r\\n                       Accessions in 1841-1842._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants who came from Rollaug, Numedal, in 1839, was\\r\\nGunnul Olson Vindeig, though, as we have seen, he did not come in\\r\\nNattestad\\'s party. Through the illness of a child he was prevented\\r\\nfrom emigrating with Nattestad, as he had intended. Coming later in\\r\\nthe year, he went via Chicago, directly to Jefferson Prairie, where\\r\\nhe remained during the winter. In the early spring of 1840, about the\\r\\ntime our Vossings, spoken of above, are moving north to locate on their\\r\\nclaims, Vindeig built or bought a boat at Beloit, and this being ready,\\r\\nhe, with a companion, Gjermund Knudson Sunde, rowed north along the\\r\\nRock River, up Koshkonong Lake and Koshkonong Creek, into the Town of\\r\\nChristiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the journey should have been made in a boat up Rock River\\r\\nagainst the stream, may sound like a legend; why not have walked this\\r\\ncomparatively short distance (about forty miles), just as Gilderhus and\\r\\nparty had walked the much longer distance from La Salle County? The\\r\\nNorwegian pioneers were good walkers and seem to have loved walking.\\r\\nVindeig evidently did not. That he actually navigated up stream I\\r\\ntake, however, not to be merely a local or family legend, for it\\r\\nis vouched for by his subsequent neighbors and comes down to us on\\r\\ngood authority. I myself visited Ole Gunnulson, Vindeig\\'s son, who\\r\\nis still residing on the old homestead, last August (1908), and also\\r\\nreceived his confirmation of the route his father took in the spring\\r\\nof 1840. Lars Lier, a neighbor of Ole Gunnulson, is cited by Prof. R.\\r\\nB. Anderson as having been told by Gjermund Sunde himself, that they\\r\\nhad tied the boat a little below the Anikstad ford, where the Funkeli\\r\\nbridge was afterwards built. Evidence comes also from some of the\\r\\noldest pioneers of the locality, as Halvor Kravik and Jens P. Vehus.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunnul Vindeig and Sunde returned soon after to Beloit, as they had\\r\\ncome, by way of the Rock River. Thereupon Vindeig, with his wife,\\r\\nGuri, and two sisters, moved from Jefferson Prairie via Milton,\\r\\nto Koshkonong, driving in a covered wagon, and proceeded to take\\r\\npossession of the land he had selected. He soon had erected a cottage\\r\\nof one room, with an attic accessible by ladder.[134] The land which\\r\\nVindeig located on is the south half of the northwest quarter of\\r\\nsection thirty-four. There he lived until his untimely death by\\r\\naccident in October, 1846.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [134] Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 338.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [135] He was killed by a loaded wagon tipping over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGjermund Sunde selected forty acres of land directly north of\\r\\nVindeig\\'s home, which he later, however, sold to Ole Lier. The land\\r\\nwhich Vindeig purchased was recorded in the land office at Milwaukee\\r\\non May twenty-second, 1840, just sixteen days after the purchase by\\r\\nGilderhus and Bolstad was recorded. There has been much discussion as\\r\\nto whether the Vossing party or Vindeig built the first house in the\\r\\nTown of Christiana. Our first group of settlers had selected their land\\r\\nthe fall before and came north in April, 1840. We have seen that the\\r\\nlarge log-cabin they constructed was hastily and poorly built. I assume\\r\\nthat either they all together, erected this immediately upon arriving\\r\\nand taking possession of their claims in 1840; or else, the hewing of\\r\\ntimber and the erecting of the cabin was begun by the two who remained,\\r\\nwhile Gilderhus and his companion went to Milwaukee to file their\\r\\nclaims. It might then have been built at the close of April, or more\\r\\nprobably, the beginning of May. Now Vindeig\\'s purchase was recorded\\r\\nMay twenty-second; but as he seems to have gone direct from Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie to Koshkonong, he evidently had built his cottage and shelter\\r\\nfor the family before he started for Milwaukee. There can, therefore,\\r\\nhave been very little difference in time between the two. Absolute\\r\\nproof of the priority of either, it is not possible to obtain, it seems\\r\\nto me, but I am inclined to think the cottage erected by Gilderhus,\\r\\nBolstad, and party, was the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now turn to our third group of settlers, most of them\\r\\nimmigrants from Stavanger, who were living in La Salle County. These\\r\\nfour men were Thorsten Olson Bjaaland, Amund Anderson Hornefjeld,\\r\\nBjörn Anderson Kvelve, and Lars Olson Dugstad. The first of\\r\\nthese--Bjaaland--had come in the sloop in 1825; he is the only slooper\\r\\nwho came to Wisconsin, and the last of that party whom we shall meet in\\r\\nour excursion down through the years of immigration. The second of this\\r\\ngroup was also from the Province of Stavanger, being born on the Island\\r\\nof Moster in 1806. We have seen that he came to America in 1836, and\\r\\nthat he had settled in La Salle County, where he lived for four years.\\r\\nThe third member of the party, Björn Kvelve, we have also met with\\r\\namong the arrivals of 1836; he had been living mostly in Chicago and La\\r\\nSalle County. He had come from Vikedal Parish in Ryfylke. Three other\\r\\nmen, Erick Johanneson Savik, Lars Scheie, and Amund Anderson Rossaland,\\r\\nintimate friends of Kvelve, were of the party, but these did not settle\\r\\non Koshkonong.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1840, these seven men decided to go north in search\\r\\nof homesteads.[136] From Gilderhus and Bolstad they had received\\r\\ninformation of Koshkonong and they decided also to go there and inspect\\r\\nthe locality. About the middle of May, I take it, they started on\\r\\nfoot for Wisconsin. The way led by Shabbona Grove, in De Kalb County,\\r\\nthrough Rockford, Beloit, Janesville, and Milton. They crossed the\\r\\nRock River at Goodrich\\'s Ferry, now Newville, then pushed on until\\r\\nthey reached the southern line of Dane County, stopping in the Town\\r\\nof Albion, near Koshkonong Creek,[137] and about four miles north,\\r\\nslightly by east, of Lake Koshkonong. Here they found country that\\r\\nsuited them in every way. Björn Kvelve is said to have exclaimed: \"This\\r\\nis indeed the Land of Canaan!\" Here woods were plentiful, the soil was\\r\\nrich, a vigorous winding stream teeming with fish, ran near by, and not\\r\\nfar off there was a large lake.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [136] For these facts I acknowledge indebtedness chiefly to Prof.\\r\\n        R. B. Anderson, who is a son of Björn Anderson Kvelve; he\\r\\n        gives an account of the journey of these men on pages 347-354\\r\\n        of his book, and a sketch of his parents pages 155-165; see\\r\\n        also page 171, and 245.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [137] Then a little river; now it is almost dried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see that the Stavangerings, as the Vossings, looked for wood and\\r\\nwater; they did not realize the superior advantages of the prairie, and\\r\\nthat it would yield much quicker returns for their labor. And yet there\\r\\nwas good reason for their choice, and we shall find that quite often\\r\\nthe early Norwegian pioneers located in a woodland tract near a stream\\r\\nor a lake. It was undoubtedly an inducement to build near a wood, where\\r\\nthe timber for the usual log-cabin was near at hand, and it was highly\\r\\ndesirable to locate within access of that primary necessity of life,\\r\\nwater. In this region, then, our party selected land. Amund Hornefjeld\\r\\nchose the east half of the southeast quarter of section one,[138] and\\r\\nBjörn Kvelve, the west half of the same quarter section.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [138] So the description reads but the Amund Anderson homestead\\r\\n        is the east half of the northwest quarter, and the Kvelve\\r\\n        homestead is directly south.\\r\\n\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland chose eighty acres immediately north of Kvelve\\'s,\\r\\nconsequently in section two, while Lars Dugstad took the east\\r\\nhalf of the southwest quarter of section one. Having made these\\r\\nselections,[139] they walked to Milwaukee to file their claims and\\r\\nperfect their purchase.[140] This is recorded at the land office under\\r\\ndate of June twenty-second, 1840, just one month, therefore, after\\r\\nentry was made of Vindeig\\'s claim in section thirty-four in Christiana,\\r\\nthe next township and section north. Amund Rossaland selected a piece\\r\\nof land near that of Björn Kvelve, but he was later informed that it\\r\\nhad already been taken;[141] so Rossaland did not settle on Koshkonong,\\r\\nbut went to Jefferson Prairie, as did also Lars Scheie, thence again\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [139] Thorsten Bjaaland and Amund Hornefjeld built shanties on\\r\\n        their land before leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [140] Their names are given as: Omund Anderson, Birn Anderson, Lars\\r\\n        Olson, and Foster Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [141] It was soon after taken possession of by William Fulton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party then returned to La Salle County, Illinois, and did\\r\\nnot move to Albion Township and take possession of their land before\\r\\nthe spring of 1841. Erik Savik became ill upon their return to La\\r\\nSalle County when he was asked if he, too, didn\\'t wish to go along to\\r\\nMilwaukee and purchase land, he answered: \"I think I can get a bit of\\r\\nground here from Ole Middlepeint.\"[142] His prophecy proved true, for\\r\\nhe died there in June, 1840. Erik Johanneson Savik and wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nhad emigrated from Kvindherred in 1836, locating in Rochester, New\\r\\nYork. A son, John, was born to them there in December, 1836. The\\r\\nfollowing year they seem to have removed to La Salle County, Illinois.\\r\\nTheir daughter, Anne Berthe, was born there in November, 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [142] That is, Ole O. Hetletveidt. This incident is related in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ in September, 1903; the words were: eg faar meg nok\\r\\n        ein Flæk Jord her hos han Ola Meddlepeint.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the spring, Kvelve and Bjaaland moved to Koshkonong with their\\r\\nfamilies, following the same route they had taken before. Bjaaland\\r\\ndrove a yoke of oxen, and Kvelve a yoke of black steers, which were\\r\\nnot yet broke, says Arnold A. Anderson, oldest son of Kvelve, and who\\r\\nwas in the party; both teams were hitched to a wagon owned by Kvelve.\\r\\nKvelve\\'s family consisted, at the time, of wife and four children, two\\r\\ndaughters having been born since the arrival in America in 1836.[143]\\r\\nThorsten Bjaaland (born in 1795 in Haa Parish, about thirty [American]\\r\\nmiles south of Stavanger, Norway) was still unmarried when he came to\\r\\nDane County, as was also Lars Dugstad. The latter evidently came north\\r\\nfrom La Salle County about the same time as Kvelve and Bjaaland. Amund\\r\\nHornefjeld married Ingeborg Johnson, widow of Erik Savik, in La Salle\\r\\nCounty, in June, 1841, and he, with wife and her two children, came\\r\\nnorth to Albion a few weeks later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [143] Arnold Andrew Anderson was born in Norway in 1832. The second\\r\\n        son of Kvelve, Augustinus Meldahl Bruun, was born in 1834. A\\r\\n        daughter was born and died in Rochester, New York, where the\\r\\n        Kvelve family lived 1836-37. Elizabeth was born in La Salle\\r\\n        County, Illinois in 1837, and Cecelia in 1840. A daughter,\\r\\n        Martha, was born in Albion Township in the fall of 1841,\\r\\n        being, it seems, the first white child born in the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, therefore, just twelve persons who located in northeastern\\r\\nAlbion Township that spring. The Hornefjeld family moved directly\\r\\ninto the shanty Amund had built before leaving in 1840. Dugstad made\\r\\na dugout on the side of a hill near the creek, in which he continued\\r\\nto live till 1855, when he married and moved into a large log-house.\\r\\nBjörn Kvelve erected a log-house on his farm immediately upon arriving\\r\\nin 1841, the logs having been cut by men engaged to do so, during\\r\\nthe winter of 1840-41. These men were Lars Kvendalen and Knut Olson\\r\\nVindeig. We shall now pass to the account of their arrival, and that of\\r\\nothers who came in 1840-41.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _New Accessions to the Koshkonong Settlement in\\r\\n           1840-1841. The Growth of the Settlement in 1842._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first explorers of Koshkonong from La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nin 1839, attracted others in their train from the same region the\\r\\nfollowing year, so Jefferson Prairie and Chicago sent new recruits\\r\\nfollowing Gunnul Vindeig in the summer of 1840. The first of these\\r\\nwere the two we have mentioned at the end of the preceding chapter,\\r\\nnamely, Lars Kvendalen and Knud Vindeig, a brother of Gunnul; both were\\r\\nsingle men. They came there early in the summer of 1840, and met in\\r\\nAlbion Township Björn Kvelve and Lars Dugstad before these had left for\\r\\nMilwaukee and Illinois in June, 1840. Knud Vindeig and Lars Kvendalen\\r\\n(the latter also from Numedal) came to America in the fall of 1839.\\r\\nAnother brother of Gunnul, namely Hellik Vindeig, and two sisters,\\r\\nBerit and Anna, came to America in the fall of 1840. As said, Kvelve\\r\\nmet Knud Vindeig and Kvendalen in Albion Township in the summer of\\r\\n1840, and he engaged them to split rails during the winter of 1840-41,\\r\\nso as to have them ready at hand when he should come there to locate\\r\\nwith his family in 1841.[144] These two men did not take land, but\\r\\nworked for a time for others in the settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [144] See above, page 179.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of the same year came Hellik Vindeig and Nils Kvendalen\\r\\n(generally called Nils Halling), but the latter did not remain there\\r\\nlong. The sister, Anna, married Nils Bolstad in 1841 (see above, page\\r\\n171). About a year later Berit married John G. Smith, a man who played\\r\\na role as both doctor and preacher among the pioneers in the forties.\\r\\nThere were no further additions to the southern part of the settlement\\r\\nin the fall of 1840, so far as I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the fall of that year Lars Davidson Rekve[145] came to\\r\\nKoshkonong and selected land in the Town of Deerfield. Entry of this\\r\\nwas made at Milwaukee on December eighth, 1840; the land was the\\r\\nsouth half of the southwest quarter of section twenty-eight, about a\\r\\nmile south of Deerfield, and two miles northwest of the eighty acres\\r\\nselected by Gilderhus in the spring. Together with Rekve came also\\r\\nOle K. Gilderhus, who had immigrated from Voss, Norway, in 1839. When\\r\\nthey reached Albion they stopped over night at the house of Thorsten\\r\\nBjaaland, who had not yet returned to Illinois for the winter. Then\\r\\nthey travelled north until they came to the place where the four\\r\\nsettlers from Voss had erected a log cabin the spring before. Not\\r\\nhaving the means wherewith to make improvements on his land, Rekve\\r\\nsoon after (summer 1841) went to Muskegon, Michigan, where he secured\\r\\nemployment in a sawmill. He did not settle in Dane County before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [145] L. D. Reque is still living in Deerfield, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf now we pass on to the year 1841, we shall find that there were\\r\\nseveral accessions to the Koshkonong settlement in that year. It is to\\r\\nbe observed, first, that a small group of immigrants came from Voss\\r\\nin 1841. They were: Anders Nilson Lie, with wife, Gunvor Sjursdatter\\r\\n(Gilderhus), and two children, Rasmus Grane, Ole Grane, Kolbein\\r\\nVestreim, Nils Vikje, Lars J. Mön, Knut Larson Böe, and Anna Solheim.\\r\\nThese had emigrated with a small brig that carried iron to Boston;\\r\\nthence they went to Racine County, Wisconsin, and Koshkonong, by the\\r\\nusual route. John Haldorson Björgo, who had emigrated from Voss in\\r\\n1838, as we have seen, also came to Koshkonong in the spring of 1841,\\r\\nand Ole Severson Gilderhus[146] came a short time after. The latter\\r\\nhad emigrated in 1840, having remained in Chicago during the winter.\\r\\nBjörgo settled in the Town of Christiana in section nine, Ole Gilderhus\\r\\na little farther north in Deerfield Township. \"None but Norwegians\\r\\nwere then living in these regions,\" writes Björgo twenty-seven years\\r\\nlater.[147] Björgo and Ole Gilderhus had, of course, arrived before\\r\\nAnders Nilson Lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [146] A brother of Nils Gilderhus.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [147] Interview printed in _Billed-Magazin_, 1869, page 387. Late\\r\\n        in the summer of 1841 a few Americans came and settled there.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first winter John Björgo lived in a small log-house;\\r\\nhis nearest white neighbor lived about three miles away. As he was\\r\\nunmarried he was obliged to cook and do all his own housework. Near by\\r\\nan Indian tribe had erected a camp, where they remained from that fall\\r\\nuntil the next spring. Björgo says of them that they were friendly and\\r\\nneighborly, and he never suffered inconvenience because of them; \"they\\r\\nwere often my guests, as I also visited them, and it never occurred to\\r\\nme to have any fear of the son of the desert. Nor did they ever give me\\r\\ncause for that; for they were peaceful and gladly shared their meagre\\r\\nsupplies with those who needed their help.\"[148]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [148] John Björgo died in October, 1868; his wife, Martha, died in\\r\\n        May, 1898. They are both buried in West Koshkonong Cemetery,\\r\\n        as Rev. G. G. Krostu of Utica, Wisconsin, informs me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now return to the party of eleven persons who came with Anders\\r\\nLie. The son, Nils A. Lie, Deerfield, Wisconsin, writes that after\\r\\na long and trying voyage they arrived in Boston whence they went to\\r\\nRacine, arriving there in December. There they hired two Swedes to take\\r\\nthem to Muskego, where the Lie family and one other family stopped with\\r\\nEven Heg. Lie\\'s destination was the home of his brother-in-law, Nils\\r\\nGilderhus, in Dane County. Leaving his family, he soon after set out on\\r\\nfoot for Koshkonong, not meeting anyone he could speak with before he\\r\\nreached Fort Atkinson. Here an American took him across the Rock River\\r\\nin a canoe, and by waiting there a day he was joined by two immigrants\\r\\nfrom Numedal,[149] who walked with him as far as Koshkonong. Thence he\\r\\ncontinued north to his brother-in-law\\'s place in Deerfield Township.\\r\\nWe have seen that Nils Gilderhus made a dugout early in the winter of\\r\\n1840-41, having found the cabin they had built in the spring too cold.\\r\\nIn this dugout Anders Lie and family[150] also lived during the winters\\r\\nof 1841-42 and 1842-43. In the meantime Anders Lie worked for others,\\r\\nsaving up all he could with a view to buying a home for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [149] These may have been Hellik Vindeig and Nils Kvendalen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [150] The family being sent for soon after; his wife, Gunvor\\r\\n        Sjursdatter, was born in 1805; the children were Martha (born\\r\\n        1838) and Nils (born 1841).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1843 he bought forty acres farther west in the northeast corner of\\r\\nthe town of Pleasant Spring, becoming the first Norwegian to settle in\\r\\nthat township; selling this out in the fall of 1844 to Peder Gjerde,\\r\\nhe located on section thirty-two in Deerfield Township, where he lived\\r\\nmost of the time till his death in 1907.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [151] After his wife\\'s death he lived some years in North and South\\r\\n        Dakota. Anders Lee was born in 1814, and attained therefore\\r\\n        to the good old age of ninety-two. His wife died in 1876;\\r\\n        they were married three years before leaving Norway. Anders\\r\\n        Lee left three sons, Nils A. in Deerfield, Sever Lee in\\r\\n        Grafton, N. D., and Andrew Lee of Washington County, N. D.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how long the rest of Anders Lee\\'s party remained in Muskego I\\r\\nam not able to say at this moment. Nils Lie writes in 1902 that they\\r\\nall came to Koshkonong, and I accept that as authoritative; but I\\r\\nmay add that the names of Grane, Vikje, Vestreim, Mön, or Böe, do\\r\\nnot appear in the roll of members of Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson\\'s\\r\\nchurch in Koshkonong for the years 1844 to 1850, which is elsewhere\\r\\npublished in this volume. Nor have I been able to trace them in the\\r\\ntowns of Christiana or Deerfield in the years 1842 to 1844. They do\\r\\nnot appear as purchasers of land, and probably left for other regions\\r\\nsoon after coming to Koshkonong. One member of the group who came from\\r\\nVoss in 1839, with Ole K. Gilderhus and others, did soon after come to\\r\\nKoshkonong, however, namely, Knut Brække. He and his wife located in\\r\\nDeerfield Township in 1843; it was he who, in 1844, bought the large\\r\\nlog-cabin built by Nils Gilderhus in 1840. He then removed it farther\\r\\nsoutheast (in the same town), where later it became the property of\\r\\nErik Lee, the father of Andrew E. Lee, of South Dakota.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [152] Andrew E. Lee was governor of South Dakota from 1896-1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also several accessions from Numedal in 1842. The first of\\r\\nthese, I believe, were Jens Pederson Vehus, from Nore Annex of Rollaug\\r\\nParish, Numedal, and Thore Knudson Nore and sons, Knut, Lars, Ole and\\r\\nSæbjörn, also from Nore.[153] With them came also Halvor Funkelien,\\r\\na native of Kongsberg. Jens Vehus was a brother of Gunnul Vindeig\\'s\\r\\nwife. All three of these came directly from Norway. Jens Vehus settled\\r\\nabout three-quarters of a mile southeast of Gunnul Vindeig, on the\\r\\nnorth half of the northeast quarter of section thirty-five. Later\\r\\nin the summer, and in the fall, this locality received new recruits\\r\\nfrom Numedal, who came for the most part directly from Norway via New\\r\\nYork, Milwaukee, and Muskego, to Koshkonong. Others came from Chicago,\\r\\nLa Salle County, and Jefferson Prairie, principally to the towns of\\r\\nChristiana and Deerfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [153] There Nore located across the Jefferson County line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants from Numedal who located there later in the year\\r\\nof 1842 were: Ole Helgeson Lien, wife Turi,[154] and children, Barbro\\r\\nand Ole, from Nore; Niels Olson Smetbak, wife Barbro Olsdatter, and\\r\\nfamily, from Nore; Mrs. Ole Bakli (Bagley), widow, and her son, Ole,\\r\\nfrom Flesberg; Björn Guldbrandsen Mörkvold, wife Asbjör and son,\\r\\nGuldbrand; Hellik Gunderson Hvashovd and wife, Marit, from Flesberg;\\r\\nHellik\\'s parents, Gunder Gunderson Hvashovd and wife, Kirsti; Mari\\r\\nGuldbrandsen (cousin of Gunnar Hvashovd) and her daughter, Kristi (born\\r\\nKristoffersen 1826); Herbrand Tollefson Mörkvold and son, Ole, and\\r\\ndaughter, Ragnild; Torstein Levorsen Bergrud, wife Kirsti Gundersdatter\\r\\n(born Hvashovd) and son, Levor, from Flesberg; Thore Olson Kaasa, wife\\r\\nAnne Torsteinsdatter, and daughter Aslau, from Rollaug; Ole Amundson\\r\\nBuind, wife Helene (Brandt), and daughter Anne, from Flesberg; Gjertrud\\r\\nOlsdatter Sælabakka (born 1822), from Rollaug; Juul Gisleson Hamre\\r\\n(born 1805), with wife Anne Gundersdatter, and children, Gisle,\\r\\nKjersti, and Gunder, and his sister, Anne Gislesdatter, from Flesberg\\r\\n(born 1797); Hellik Helliksen Foslieiet (born 1812), his wife Sigrid,\\r\\nand children, Hellik (born 1833), Anders (born 1835), Marit (born\\r\\n1838), Christoffer (born 1841).[155]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [154] Turi Lien, whose maiden name was Smetbak, was born in 1811;\\r\\n        she died in 1899; Ole Lien died in 1850; the widow then\\r\\n        married Lars T. Nore.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [155] The daughters Christine and Sigrid were born in 1842 and 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those mentioned here the Hvashovd, Hamre, and Bergrud families, Mari\\r\\nGulbrandsen and her daughter, Christi, and one or two more, nineteen in\\r\\nall, left Flesberg, Numedal, in May and arrived in Muskego in October.\\r\\nHere they stopped two or three weeks with Even Hegg, whose wife was a\\r\\nrelative of Mari Gulbrandsen. Some early settlers on Liberty Prairie\\r\\n(Koshkonong) took their baggage to Koshkonong while the immigrants\\r\\nwalked. These facts are told me by Reverend K. A. Kasberg of Spring\\r\\nGrove, Minnesota, as related by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Halvor Kravik,\\r\\nwho was in the party (she was Kristi Kristoffersen). She relates also\\r\\nthat \"in the spring (hence 1843) she and her mother walked to Madison\\r\\nto get work. There was only one house on the whole road, that of an\\r\\nAmerican family; but their friendly \\'come in, come in\\' (Norwegian _kom\\r\\nind, kom ind_, but pronounced alike) was easily understood. Here we\\r\\nwere well entertained over night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Telemarken the following came:[156] Richard Björnson Rotkjön\\r\\n(born 1816), and brother Aslak (born 1826), from Vinje; Torstein\\r\\nTorsteinson Gaarden, from Tin; Ole Höljeson Yttreböe, with wife,\\r\\nMargit, and children, Johanne and Anne, and Halvor Hansen Dalstiel\\r\\n(Dalastöl), from Hvideseid; Ole Torsteinson Aasnes, wife, Ingeborg,\\r\\nand daughter, Hæge, from Vinje; Ole Gulliksen Barstad (born 1791),\\r\\nwife, Ingeborg Jonsdatter (born 1799), and children, Vetle, Eivind,\\r\\nand Halvor, from Siljord; Ole Olson Haugan, from Siljord; Torbjörn\\r\\nHavredalen, wife, Lisa, and family, from Vinje;[157] and Gunhild\\r\\nSaamundsdatter (born 1798), from Laurdal. Furthermore Guro Olsdatter\\r\\n(born 1821), from Nissedal, and Thomas Johnson Landeman (born 1804),\\r\\nfrom Sandsværd; and Torbjörn Havredalen with wife, Lisa, and family,\\r\\nalso came to Koshkonong that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [156] Many of these located in the eastern and northern part of the\\r\\n        settlement a year or two later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [157] Who located in Town of Deerfield. Some of these, as Dalstiel,\\r\\n        left Koshkonong a few years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great majority of these made the town of Christiana their first\\r\\nstopping place. So that, by the end of 1842, there were perhaps more\\r\\nimmigrants found together within the area of that township than in any\\r\\nof the other settlements founded during the preceding years, 1839-1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this time that the question of a name for the new town was\\r\\nbeing mooted. Gunnul Vindeig was given the privilege of naming it, and\\r\\nhe decided for Christiania, adopting the name of the capital of Norway.\\r\\nThe form as it came to stand, however, would seem to be a typical\\r\\ninstance of that slovenly habit of slurring syllables in foreign names,\\r\\nwhich so often appears in the records of American officials or clerks\\r\\nin land offices in those days. Yet the _Billed-Magazin_ is authority\\r\\nfor the statement that Gunnul Vindeig himself was the cause of the\\r\\nerror, he, by mistake, writing Christiana instead of the correct\\r\\nChristiania.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime new colonies are springing up elsewhere and the\\r\\nsettlements previously established are growing and thriving. Before,\\r\\ntherefore, tracing the further development on Koshkonong Prairie, it\\r\\nwill be in order to note the advance in other localities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The First Norwegian Settlement in Iowa, at Sugar\\r\\n                         Creek, in Lee County_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same year that records the genesis of the Koshkonong Settlement,\\r\\nalso registers the founding of the earliest Norwegian colony in Iowa,\\r\\nthat of Sugar Creek, in Lee County, in the southeastern part of the\\r\\nstate. When Kleng Peerson was on his way to Missouri in 1837 (see\\r\\nabove, page 117), it seems that he passed through the southeastern\\r\\ncorner of Iowa; he was, therefore, in all probability the first\\r\\nNorwegian to enter the State of Iowa.[158] Iowa had been organized\\r\\nas a territory in 1838. The settlers in Shelby County, Missouri,\\r\\nwere dissatisfied, and, having heard of the natural resources of\\r\\nthe Territory of Iowa, immediately to the north, and that good land\\r\\nwith a near market[159] could be had in the southeastern part of the\\r\\nterritory, they decided to move to Iowa. Going north into Lee County,\\r\\nIowa, they located at a place six miles northwest of Keokuk, known as\\r\\nSugar Creek. Andrew Simonsen and most of the settlers in Shelby County\\r\\ncame at that time; but Peerson remained in Missouri. Here, however,\\r\\nthey found a small colony of Norwegians who had, it seems, but recently\\r\\nestablished themselves. With the exception of one to be mentioned\\r\\nbelow, it is not known who these earlier settlers were, and I have not\\r\\nbeen able to ascertain where they came from.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [158] Though not the first Scandinavian, for a Dane, Niels\\r\\n        Christian Boye, came to Muscatine, Iowa, in 1837. In 1842\\r\\n        he located in Iowa City; a daughter, Julia Boye, the only\\r\\n        surviving member of the family, lives now in Iowa City.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [159] One of the settlers in Shelby County, Missouri, was Peter\\r\\n        Omundson Gjilje. As an illustration of the state of\\r\\n        wilderness of the country around them it is related that\\r\\n        Gjilje once walked for nine whole days in the forest tract\\r\\n        before he found human habitation. One morning early he heard\\r\\n        a cock crow, and then he found people. During these days he\\r\\n        had lived on wild strawberries. These facts are related by\\r\\n        Mr. B. L. Wick of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nKleng Peerson has been accredited with being the founder also of the\\r\\nSugar Creek Settlement, but there is no proof that he previously\\r\\nselected the site or even that he located there in 1840. Indeed the\\r\\nevidence goes rather to show that he never actually settled at Sugar\\r\\nCreek. His home in the following years was probably chiefly in Shelby\\r\\nCounty, Missouri; in 1847 he sold his land there and joined the\\r\\nSwedish colony in Henry County, Illinois, which had been founded in\\r\\n1846. Nor does it seem to me that Hans Barlien was a member of the\\r\\nMissouri colony, as Professor Anderson suggests. No mention of Barlien\\r\\ncan be found in connection with the Shelby County colony or any other\\r\\nsettlement. It seems more probable that he went to the Fox River\\r\\nSettlement when he came from Norway in 1837, but with a few others left\\r\\nin 1840, coming to Lee County somewhat before the party that came with\\r\\nAndrew Simonsen from Shelby County. They may originally have received\\r\\ntheir knowledge of this locality from Peerson. Barlien himself may have\\r\\nbeen in La Salle County when Peerson in 1837 returned from his journey\\r\\nto Missouri. It was, then, Barlien and a few immigrants with him whom\\r\\nAndrew Simonsen and others from Shelby County found already settled at\\r\\nSugar Creek in the spring of 1840. If this is correct then the first\\r\\nNorwegian settler in Iowa and the real founder of the first Norwegian\\r\\ncolony in the state is Hans Barlien, who was born at Overhalden in the\\r\\nprovince of Trondhjem about 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1838 Kleng Peerson went to Norway to gather recruits for the Shelby\\r\\nCounty colony; the following year he brought back with him from\\r\\nStavanger County the three brothers, Peter, William, and Hans Tesman,\\r\\nNils Olson, Ole Reierson and family, and six or seven women, all of\\r\\nwhom came to Missouri; but several of these went to Lee County, Iowa,\\r\\nthe following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as known, the first settlers who came with Andrew Simonsen from\\r\\nMissouri were: Omund Olson, Knud Slogvig,[160] Jacob O. Hetletvedt,\\r\\nMrs. Thorstein T. Rue and her sons, Thorstein and John, Peter Omundson\\r\\nGjilje, Erik Öie, Ole Öiesöen, and the three Tesman brothers; some of\\r\\nthe rest seem to have followed later. Lars Tallakson settled there\\r\\nabout the same time, but he came from Clark County, Missouri, where\\r\\nhe had located in 1838. Gjermund Helgeson[161] was also among the\\r\\nearliest settlers, and Jacob Slogvig, who had gone back to La Salle\\r\\nCounty in 1838, likewise later located at Sugar Creek. Among the\\r\\nsubsequent arrivals were Ole Soppeland, Hans William, C. Person, and\\r\\nNils and Christ Nelson; these located there before 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [160] Jacob Slogvig was also among the first settlers; he had\\r\\n        returned from Shelby County, Missouri, to La Salle County, in\\r\\n        1838, as also had Andrew Askeland.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [161] Helgeson may have come with Barlien from Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading spirit in the colony was undoubtedly Hans Barlien. He was\\r\\na man of great natural endowment, and he had a fair education. In\\r\\nNorway he had been a pronounced nationalist of the Wergeland direction\\r\\nand had taken part in the first peasant uprising. He was for a time a\\r\\nmember of the Storthing (the national parliament). In religion he was a\\r\\nliberal, which aroused the hostility of the clergy, while his radical\\r\\npolitical views called forth the enmity of the official class. He owned\\r\\na printing establishment at Overgaarden, and published a paper[162]\\r\\nin which he did not hesitate to give expression to the principles\\r\\nfor which he stood. This frequently involved him in litigation; and,\\r\\nfeeling himself persecuted, he at last decided to emigrate to America\\r\\nin 1837.[163] Barlien seems to be the second Norwegian emigrant from\\r\\nTrondhjem.[164] Lars Tallakson came from Bergen, while the rest of the\\r\\ncolonists were mostly from the region of Stavanger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [162] _Melkeveien_, the Milky Way.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [163] See J. B. Wist, in _Bygdejaevning_, Madison, Wisconsin, 1903,\\r\\n        p. 158; also _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_, pp.\\r\\n        235-236, and _Republikaneren_, February 9, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [164] The first was Ole Rynning. See above, p. 107, and\\r\\n        _Normaendene i Amerika_ by Knud Langeland, pp. 26-29.\\r\\nLee County was but little settled at that time;[165] land was bought\\r\\nof the Indians for a nominal price, but it often became expensive\\r\\nenough in the end, since it proved very difficult for many of the\\r\\nsettlers to obtain a clear title from the United States. This is one\\r\\nreason why the settlement did not grow, though probably not the chief\\r\\ncause. In 1843 there were between thirty and forty families, writes\\r\\nJohn Reierson,[166] but in 1856 there were, according to the census of\\r\\nthat year, only sixty-eight Norwegians in the county. This number had\\r\\nin 1885 decreased to thirty-one. In the fifties many of the settlers\\r\\nmoved to other localities, but throughout the forties there was a\\r\\nprosperous colony that contributed not a little to the development of\\r\\nthe community and the county in that early period. The settlement is of\\r\\nspecial interest in that it was the first Norwegian settlement in Iowa.\\r\\nIts founding inaugurated Norwegian colonization in the state which,\\r\\nparticularly in the fifties, resulted in the establishment of a score\\r\\nof extensive settlements in the central and the northern counties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [165] The first postoffice was established in Lee County in 1841.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [166] _Veiviser for Emigranter_, 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many reasons why the Sugar Creek Settlement did not grow\\r\\nas did the later settlements north and west. First of all, land was\\r\\nnot of the best in Lee County. And then, the locality was rather too\\r\\nfar south, Norwegians have everywhere in America thriven best in the\\r\\nmore northerly localities. Again, the tide of emigration from the\\r\\nvicinity of Stavanger was not sufficiently heavy to recruit the various\\r\\nsettlements already established by immigrants from that region. The\\r\\nmajority of those who came went direct to the Fox River Settlement in\\r\\nNorthern Illinois, which offered unsurpassed natural advantages. To\\r\\nbe sure, the Shelby County (Missouri) and the Lee County settlements\\r\\nmight have been recruited from other districts in Norway. But it must\\r\\nbe remembered that such other districts as had begun to take part in\\r\\nthe emigration movement had their attention directed just at this\\r\\ntime in another direction. The other provinces in question are Voss,\\r\\nTelemarken, and Numedal. It was representatives of these that founded\\r\\nthe Wisconsin settlements in 1839-40, and in them the great majority\\r\\nof immigrants from those provinces located in the following decade.\\r\\nThis is also true of those who came from Hardanger, Sogn,[167] and from\\r\\nWestern Norway in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [167] Immigration from Sogn was at first directed almost\\r\\n        exclusively to Boone County, Illinois, and Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still another reason why the colony did not grow. Beyond the\\r\\ncommon desire of material betterment, there was too little of community\\r\\nof interest. It is enough to mention that several different religious\\r\\nsects were represented in the little settlement, chief among which were\\r\\nthe Quakers and the Latter Day Saints. Just across the Mississippi\\r\\nwas the town of Nauvoo,[168] which was a Mormon center at the time.\\r\\nWhen the Mormons who did not believe in polygamy established themselves\\r\\nat Lamoni some years later, many Norwegians of that belief went\\r\\nwith them.[169] And not a few of the Quakers joined American Quaker\\r\\nsettlements farther north, as in Salem, Henry County.[170] In the later\\r\\nfifties a prosperous colony was founded at and south of Legrand in\\r\\nMarshall County. A few of the early pioneers, however, remained and\\r\\ntheir descendants live in Lee County to-day. Finally, the difficulty of\\r\\nsecuring a title to the land upon which many Norwegians had settled,\\r\\nto which reference has been made above, undoubtedly drove many to seek\\r\\nhomes elsewhere.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [168] In the Fox River Settlement in Illinois many Norwegians\\r\\n        joined the Mormons and later moved to Utah. Bishop Canute\\r\\n        Peterson was one of these.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [169] The Mormons first moved into Iowa in 1839, having received\\r\\n        assurance of protection and the liberty to practice their\\r\\n        belief from Governor Lucas in that year. They located in\\r\\n        Lee County not far from Sugar Creek. The town of Nauvoo,\\r\\n        Illinois, had been bought by them. The name was changed from\\r\\n        Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [170] Omund Olson was converted to Quakerism at Salem, Henry\\r\\n        County. As early as 1842 several of the settlers joined with\\r\\n        him in erecting a meeting house on his farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [171] The question has been investigated somewhat by Mr. B. L.\\r\\n        Wick. See _Republikaneren_, February 9, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these first Norwegian pioneers in Iowa I shall here add a brief\\r\\nfinal note, as we shall not meet with them again. We have met the\\r\\nbrothers Knud and Jacob Anderson Slogvig four times as the founders\\r\\nof settlements--in Orleans County, New York, in La Salle County,\\r\\nIllinois, in Shelby County, Missouri, and in Lee County, Iowa. Jacob\\r\\nSlogvig went to California about 1850; there he became wealthy and\\r\\ndied in 1864. Knud Slogvig moved to Lee County early in the fifties,\\r\\nI believe, and died there. Hans Barlien died in the Sugar Creek\\r\\nSettlement in 1842. Mrs. Thorstein Rue and her son, Thorstein, lived in\\r\\nSugar Creek till 1846, when they went to Wisconsin, and took part in\\r\\nthe founding of the Blue Mounds Settlement in western Dane County. Lars\\r\\nTallakson settled about a decade later in La Salle County, Illinois,\\r\\nwhere he lived to a good old age.[172] Jacob Olson Hetletvedt (brother\\r\\nof the slooper, Ole O. Hetletvedt) continued to live in Lee County till\\r\\nhis death in August, 1857. His widow married Sven Kjylaa, with whom she\\r\\nthen moved to the Fox River Settlement. Per Omundson Gjilje was one of\\r\\nthe last to leave the settlement; in 1864 he removed to New Sharon,\\r\\nMahaska County, Iowa, where he died in 1895. His wife (born Karina\\r\\nBornevik, from Nærstrand, Norway) died in 1902, aged eighty-six.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [172] He died about 1900. Among those who moved to New Sharon were\\r\\n        Sjur Olson, Nils Nilson and Aad Nilson and wife Kristina;\\r\\n        Martha Erickson was until recently, at least, living in Clark\\r\\n        County, Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers at Wiota, La Fayette\\r\\n            County, and Dodgeville, Iowa County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout forty miles directly west of Rock Prairie lies Wiota, about which\\r\\ntown stretches in all directions a Norwegian settlement of considerable\\r\\nsize. It is separated from Luther Valley by Green County and lies\\r\\nonly twenty-five miles distant, northwest, from the old settlement of\\r\\nRock Run, in Illinois. Here extensive lead mines were being operated\\r\\nin the forties, and they were the means of drawing to that locality a\\r\\nlarge number of immigrants of different nationalities, many of whom,\\r\\nto be sure, only remained there temporarily, going elsewhere to buy\\r\\na home as soon as they had accumulated sufficient funds. The mines\\r\\nwere at that time called \"Hamilton Diggings.\" As early as 1840 we find\\r\\ntwo Norwegians working in these mines, namely, the brothers Andreas\\r\\nand John O. Week, both from Eidfjord, in Hardanger. The Week brothers\\r\\nseem to have been two of a party of about forty from Hardanger, who\\r\\nemigrated in 1839.[173] I do not believe, however, that either Andrew\\r\\nor John Week entered a land claim in the vicinity, and they remained\\r\\nthere only a few years. In 1844 John Week moved to Dodgeville in Iowa\\r\\nCounty, where he established a shoe store in company with John Lee,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, Norway. Andrew Week went to Marathon County some years\\r\\nlater; here he built a saw mill, which, however, was bought out by his\\r\\nbrother John in 1849, when Andrew joined the California gold-seekers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [173] They came in the same ship as Knut Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1842 Lars Davidson Reque, an immigrant from Voss in\\r\\nthe year 1839, came to Wiota. We have already met him as a purchaser\\r\\nof land in Deerfield Township, in Dane County, in December, 1840. Not\\r\\nhaving the means to begin the improvement of his land, he says, he\\r\\ndecided to go to Hamilton Diggings, and he did not take possession of\\r\\nhis land until the summer of 1842.[174] Rekve remained at the Diggings\\r\\nonly about one year. In 1841 the first permanent settlers arrived;\\r\\nthese were Per Unde, from Vik Parish, Sogn, Per Davidson Skjerveim,\\r\\nSjur Ulven, and Arne Anderson Vinje, from Voss. The first of those was,\\r\\nit seems, the earliest emigrant from Sogn to America. He was a man of\\r\\nconsiderable means, but a copy of Rynning\\'s _Sandfaerdig Beretning om\\r\\nAmerika_ fell into his hands and he decided to emigrate. He remained\\r\\nin Chicago the first year and a half or over. Ulven and Skjerveim had\\r\\ncome from Norway in 1840. Arne Vinje (born 1820) came to Chicago in\\r\\nSeptember, 1840, after having been five months on the journey. He had\\r\\nleft Norway April sixteenth with his wife,[175] and a party of twenty\\r\\nother persons from Voss. The following spring Vinje and Skjerveim,\\r\\nhaving decided to go to the mines in Wisconsin, secured each their\\r\\nyoke of oxen, and drove overland, arriving at Wiota on the seventh of\\r\\nJuly, after five days of difficult travel; Unde and Ulven came at the\\r\\nsame time. Unde immediately entered a claim on a piece of land in the\\r\\nvicinity and built a house, as did Skjerveim and Vinje a short time\\r\\nafter; these located, however, about three miles farther south.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [174] He did not actually settle there permanently before 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [175] Her maiden name was Martha Gulliksdatter Kindem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Arne Vinje the following twenty-one persons came from\\r\\nVoss that spring: Torstein Saue, his wife and son Gulleik, Lars Saue\\r\\nand wife, Klaus Grimestad and wife, Arne Anderson and wife and infant\\r\\nson Andrew, Knudt Hylle, Ole S. Gilderhus, Knudt Rokne, Mads Sonve,\\r\\nBaar Lawson Böe (a brother of Iver Lawson), Lars Röthe, Brynnel Ronve,\\r\\ntwo young ladies from Saue, one from Ronve and one from Gilderhus. In\\r\\ndiscussing the voyage Vinje says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The bottom of the ship in which we sailed was declared by Capt.\\r\\n  Ankerson to be one hundred and fifty years old and when, in\\r\\n  midocean, we encountered a severe storm, the timbers sustaining\\r\\n  the upper berths gave way, precipitating them upon the lower ones,\\r\\n  and the screams and cries of the frightened passengers added to\\r\\n  the fury of the storm, almost created a panic on board. As for\\r\\n  myself, I seized a heavy chest which I intended throwing overboard\\r\\n  to use as a support in the water in case the ship foundered. Even\\r\\n  Hegg, and others from \"Östlandet,\" who came from Drammen with Capt.\\r\\n  Ankerson, stopped in Milwaukee, while we from Voss came on to\\r\\n  Chicago, where my wife and I were received into the home of Sjur\\r\\n  Ulven and family. Mrs. Ulven being my wife\\'s cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Knudt Hylle and myself began our first work in Chicago upon the\\r\\n  streets of the (then) westside. My work was handling a heavy plank\\r\\n  scraper, drawn by a yoke of oxen and used to scrape the sod from\\r\\n  the sides of the road into the center.\\r\\n\\r\\n  At this time occurred the election of General Harrison to the\\r\\n  Presidency. The candidate was the \"People\\'s choice\" and I, from\\r\\n  my bed, saw a log cabin, such as he lived in, mounted upon wheels\\r\\n  and drawn through the streets to show that he was chosen from the\\r\\n  common people. That was effective electioneering!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1841 Peder Skjerveim, who had come from Norway in\\r\\n1837, having lived in Chicago in the interval, drove from Chicago up to\\r\\nHamilton Diggings to explore the region. Upon his return he reported\\r\\nthat there was government land for sale there, and Vinje and he decided\\r\\nto move thither. Peder Iverson Unde and family and Sjur Ulven went to\\r\\nthe \"Diggings\" at the same time. Of this Vinje writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n  We left Chicago on July 2nd and arrived in Wiota, or Hamilton\\'s\\r\\n  Diggings as it was then called, after a tiresome journey of five\\r\\n  days. On July 7th we passed Elgin, Illinois, in a grove near which\\r\\n  Independence day was being celebrated, on July 4th, but there was\\r\\n  then no town, only a few scattered houses. We progressed with\\r\\n  some difficulty as our wagon broke down twice during the journey.\\r\\n  The second of these accidents occurred as we were nearing Rockford\\r\\n  toward evening, when the axle gave way; but Peder Skjervheim,\\r\\n  with only an ax and an augur went into the woods nearby, and from\\r\\n  a convenient tree cut and made a new axle that night, so that we\\r\\n  proceeded safely on our way the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n  There being no bridges, we forded the rivers at Rockford and\\r\\n  Freeport. There was then not a house where the thriving city of\\r\\n  Rockford now stands and only one small grocery store at Freeport.\\r\\n  There were, at that time, no Norwegians in or around Wiota, and\\r\\n  the nearest Norwegian settlement was at Rock Run, Illinois. Peder\\r\\n  Skjervheim and I, each bought forty acres of government land in the\\r\\n  Township of Wiota, upon which we each built a log cabin and began\\r\\n  other improvements. Andres Brække also bought forty acres but soon\\r\\n  sold it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  In 1842 there came to our neighborhood three young people from\\r\\n  Voss; David Larson Fenne and wife, and his brother, Nils Fenne.\\r\\n  In 1843 there came some families from Vik, in Sogn, and settled\\r\\n  near by: Ole Iverson Unde and wife Britha, and his brother Erik\\'s\\r\\n  family. Erik died before reaching America, but his wife and\\r\\n  children settled down here. Likewise, Erik Engebrit Hove, Ole\\r\\n  Anderson and Sjur Tallakson Bruavold came at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those which Mr. Vinje mentions as arriving in 1842 may be added Isak\\r\\nJohnson from Skien,[176] and Christian Hendrickson from Lier, Norway.\\r\\nThe latter however moved to Primrose Township in Dane County in 1846.\\r\\n(See below).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [176] I am told that he came in 1841, but this seems to be a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nMathias J. Engebretsen of Gratiot, Wisconsin, tells me that Per Fenne\\r\\nand wife Martha came to Wiota in 1842, while Nils Sunve and wife\\r\\nMaline, and Ivar Fenne came in 1843; all these were from Voss. Helge\\r\\nMeland and wife from Telemarken came in 1843, as also Tore Thompson\\r\\nfrom Tindal and Ashley Gunderson from Numedal.[177] Those mentioned by\\r\\nArne Vinje at the end of the above account, Ole and Sjur Bruavolden,\\r\\ndid not settle at Wiota, it seems, before 1845, and Erik E. Hove not\\r\\nuntil 1847. These had located first at Long Prairie in Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, as had also Ingebrigt Fuglegjærdet, who came from Vik, Sogn,\\r\\nin 1844. Of the immigration from Land, Norway, to Wiota, which began\\r\\nwith Syver Johnson (Smed or Smedhögen in 1844), I shall speak in the\\r\\nnext chapter. The growth of the Jefferson Prairie Settlement will,\\r\\nhowever, claim our attention briefly first.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [177] Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson, speaking of the Wiota\\r\\n        Settlement in 1844 says, that there had been organized a\\r\\n        congregation that year, which numbered about one hundred\\r\\n        members, of whom the larger part were from Voss; these,\\r\\n        he says, had settled there for the most part in 1843. He\\r\\n        mentions Per Davidson as deacon and a leading member of the\\r\\n        church, and Knud Knudson as one who by great energy had\\r\\n        acquired considerable wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n            _Growth of the Jefferson Prairie Settlement from\\r\\n                 1841 to 1845. The First Norwegian Land\\r\\n                        Owners in Rock County._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an earlier chapter I have given an account of the coming of\\r\\nNorwegians to Jefferson Prairie in 1838-39. We found that a\\r\\nconsiderable number of persons had located there by 1840, principally\\r\\nimmigrants from Numedal. These first settlers located in the southern\\r\\nhalf of Clinton Township, but others soon came who settled still\\r\\nfarther south, so that the settlement soon came to include a portion\\r\\nof the Township of Manchester in Boone County, Illinois. The first\\r\\nsettlers here were Tönnes Tolleivson (or Tollefson) from Jæderen, and\\r\\nSvend Larson, both of whom settled in Boone County in 1840; Tollefson\\r\\nhad come to America in the fall of 1839, presumably spending the winter\\r\\nof 1839-40 on Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement thus came to be divided into a northern and a southern\\r\\npart, the immigrant settlers in the two representing different\\r\\nprovinces in Norway. The Numedalians settled as we have seen, nearer\\r\\nClinton and in general in the northern end of Jefferson Prairie; in\\r\\nfact they occupied most of the prairie proper. The southern portion,\\r\\nthe timber land, come to be settled principally by immigrants from\\r\\nVoss. Very few of these located in the Town of Clinton; they\\r\\nselected homes in the early days, for the most part, just where their\\r\\ndescendants now live, on the south side of the state line, in Illinois.\\r\\nThe whole settlement extends from about a mile and a half south of\\r\\nClinton across the prairie and into the timber which began about three\\r\\nmiles south of Clinton and extends about four miles down into Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have observed above that Ole Nattestad\\'s house became the stopping\\r\\nplace of the earliest immigrants to Jefferson Prairie. In a similar\\r\\nway D. B. Egery\\'s place,[178] located four miles southwest of the\\r\\nNattestad cabin on the trail to Beloit, became the headquarters for\\r\\nmany a Norwegian immigrant in that early day. Speaking of him, H. L.\\r\\nSkavlem gives testimony to his kindness and the readiness with which he\\r\\nlent a helping hand to the incoming settlers in his vicinity, who were\\r\\nseeking a place to establish a home in the wilderness. As soon as the\\r\\nimmigrants arrived, parties of two or three would fill their knapsacks\\r\\n(skræppe) with provisions and strike out in various directions to \"spy\\r\\nout the land.\"[179]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [178] Situated in section 26 in Turtle Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [179] H. L. Skavlem in _Scandinavians in the Early Days of Rock\\r\\n        County_, a most interesting and valuable pamphlet, though\\r\\n        very brief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegians to buy land on Jefferson Prairie were Ansten\\r\\nNattestad and Thorstein Nilsen, the date of whose purchase is December\\r\\n25th, 1839.[180] On January 25, 1840, Anders Jacobson\\'s purchase\\r\\nwas recorded, and further in the same year those of Erik Gudbrandson\\r\\n(May 16) and Kittil Newhouse (Nyhus, June 15). The first three\\r\\npurchases were in sections 32, 30 and 22, respectively, while those of\\r\\nGudbrandson and Newhouse were in section 20, all in Clinton Township.\\r\\nThe latter made a further purchase in 1842 in the same section, as did\\r\\nalso Tosten Olson. Ole Nattestad\\'s purchase was recorded on November\\r\\n25, 1842, while in September of that year Ole Newhouse (Nyhus) had\\r\\nbought three forties in sections 15 and 22, and Christoffer Newhouse\\r\\none in section 30; others were now rapidly moving in and becoming\\r\\nowners of their choice of land on the \"Prairie.\" Among these were Jas.\\r\\nHilbeitson, Erik Hilbeitson, Tore Helgeson, Erik Gulbeitson, Gulbrand\\r\\nGulbrandson, and Ole Pederson Bogstrandeiet, all in the fall of 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [180] The first Norwegian land owner in the county was however\\r\\n        Gisle Sebjörnson Halland as shown by H. L. Skavlem\\'s\\r\\n        researches. The date of Halland\\'s purchase was November 29th.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection it may be noted that Gulleik Gravdal\\'s purchase of\\r\\nland in the Town of Newark (in section 1) was recorded December 12,\\r\\n1839, and he made additions to his holdings in 1842 in sections 1 and\\r\\n9. Mrs. Gunnild Ödegaarden purchased land in 1839 and 1840, Lars H.\\r\\nSkavlem in June, 1841, and Gudbrand Olson and Mrs. Gulleik Springen\\r\\nin October, 1841. During September of the latter year four purchases\\r\\nwere also recorded in Plymouth Township, namely those of Paul Halvorson\\r\\nSkavlem, Nils Olson Vegli (Wagley) and Gunnel Holgerson, while in May,\\r\\n1840, Gulleik H. Blakestad Skavlem had become the owner of forty acres\\r\\nin Beloit Township.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [181] In December, 1842, Mrs. Gisle Halland bought forty acres in\\r\\n        Beloit Township. Her name appears as Margarett Nutes (Margrit\\r\\n        Knutsdatter).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jefferson Prairie Settlement received considerable accessions\\r\\nduring the next four years. Lena Sondal came in 1841, Haakon Paulson\\r\\nfrom Sigdal and his wife Inger came in 1842, Ole Severtson and family\\r\\nfrom Numedal, including a daughter, Petra, who is now Mrs. Henry\\r\\nJacobson (Oppedal)[182] of Clinton, came in 1843, as did also Brynild\\r\\nL. Lie and wife from Voss, Lars O. Lie from Hallingdal[183] and\\r\\nEdwin O. Wilson Næshaug. The last of these settled in Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, where he bought land in 1846, but removed to Filmore County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1854. Gunder Vedfald and family, including the sons, Ole\\r\\nand Halvor, from Telemarken also came in 1843. In the year 1844 there\\r\\nwas a considerable influx of settlers from Voss;[184] among them were:\\r\\nSjur K. Kvarma wife and four children from Voss, Brynild Dugstad,[185]\\r\\nwife and five children, Erik K. Dugstad, wife and child, Lewis Severts,\\r\\nOle Shipley and wife Guri, Lars Grane, Sjur Grane, Elling Ellingson\\r\\nand wife Magela, Ole Skutle,[186] Peder Bere and wife Britha. Also the\\r\\nfollowing came about the same time (1844 or the following year): Lars\\r\\nBaarson and wife Gudve, Guru Isakson, Sjur A. Grönlien, wife and two\\r\\nchildren, and Erik E. Slæen. Nearly all those here enumerated followed\\r\\nthe lead of Clas Isakson and settled near or south of the state line.\\r\\nFrom Vik, Sogn, Norway, there was a single settler, namely, Ole O.\\r\\nTrain. From Hardanger also there was, it seems, only one immigrant\\r\\namong those who came during this earliest period, Anna Tollefson, wife\\r\\nof Tönnes Tollefson, who, as we have seen, came to America in 1839.\\r\\nFrom Telemarken there were about twelve persons, among them Steinar E.\\r\\nHadland, wife and son, Guldmond; Gunder O. Vedfald, wife and daughter;\\r\\nEven Haatvedt and Ole A. Haatvedt and wife, besides the Vedfald family\\r\\nspoken of above. From Næs in Hallingdal we find Knud R. Væterud, a\\r\\nwidower, and his two daughters, Ingeborg and Rönnau, besides Lars O.\\r\\nLie, and from Modum, Thov Modum and wife Karen; finally Krödsherred is\\r\\nrepresented by Even Fingerson Foslien.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [182] Henry Jacobson is a son of Jacob J. Oppedal, who came from\\r\\n        Hardanger in 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [183] Frederik Frederikson\\'s wife, who was Martha Larson, also came\\r\\n        in 1843. Frederikson came some years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [184] We have seen that Clas Isakson had immigrated from Voss in\\r\\n        1840. He was the first Vossing to settle on Jefferson Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [185] Brynild Dugstad located in the northern part of the\\r\\n        settlement. A son, Knut B. Dugstad, died at Clinton, Wis., in\\r\\n        April, 1905, age 80.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [186] Ole Skutle later married Lena Sondal, who had come in 1841;\\r\\n        see above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest purchasers of land (1842) I have mentioned Ole C.\\r\\nNewhouse. He was a brother of Kristoffer and Kittil Newhouse who had\\r\\ncome in 1839. The original name, Nyhus, was in the early days changed\\r\\nto Newhouse, which is a translation of the Norwegian. Ole Newhouse\\r\\nmarried Helen Stabæk, daughter of Klemet Stabæk, who has been spoken\\r\\nof as the founder of the Rock Run Settlement in Stephenson County,\\r\\nIllinois, in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\nSjur Kvarme\\'s children included a son, Kolbein (born 1831); he lived\\r\\non Jefferson Prairie from 1844-1854, in which latter year he joined\\r\\nthe gold-seekers in California. With the proceeds of three years\\' work\\r\\nin the gold mines he came east again in 1857 and bought a farm near\\r\\nSt. Ansgar, Iowa, where he lived till his death in October, 1906. Olav\\r\\nVedfald, son of Gunder Vedfald, remained with his parents on Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie till 1850, when he purchased land and settled on Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nin Columbia County, Wisconsin.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [187] Of those who come in 1844 from Numedal were Gulleik Svensrud\\r\\n        and family, who however removed to Blue Mounds, Dane County,\\r\\n        in 1847. In 1860 he married Ingeborg Lohn who died in 1903;\\r\\n        there are five living children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the pioneers of Jefferson Prairie are also particularly to be\\r\\nnamed Reverend O. Andrewson and wife, Ragnild Paulson, both of whom\\r\\ncame to America in 1841, but did not settle in Clinton Township before\\r\\n1855; in that year Rev. Andrewson accepted a call as pastor of the\\r\\ncongregation which he had organized there in 1850. Mrs. Andrewson, who\\r\\nis now eighty-five years old, is still living there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the above survey of the growth of the Jefferson Prairie Settlement\\r\\nduring these years many names have been omitted because of the\\r\\nuncertainty among my informants as to the year of their arrival. In\\r\\na subsequent chapter I shall also outline the subsequent growth of\\r\\nthe settlement. I shall here merely note the fact that Reverend J. W.\\r\\nC. Dietrichson speaks of the congregation in 1844 as numbering 150\\r\\nmembers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Immigration to Rock Prairie from Numedal and\\r\\n                  Land in 1842 and Subsequent Years._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XI above we have given an account of the beginnings of the\\r\\nRock Prairie Settlement and traced its growth down to 1842. We shall\\r\\nhere briefly discuss the development of this settlement during the\\r\\nnext eight years. Already in the summer of 1842 a considerable number\\r\\nof immigrants came, most of them locating there permanently. I shall\\r\\nmention first Halvor N. Aaen and wife, Guri (Frögne), both from Nore in\\r\\nNumedal, who settled in Newark.[188] Halvor Stordok and Ole Stordok,\\r\\nbrothers of Gunnul Stordok mentioned before, both came in 1842. Halvor\\r\\nbought land near Sugar River Bottom; he married Ingeborg Paulson, and\\r\\nthe couple lived on the homestead till their death. Their children,\\r\\nKnud, Halvor, Inge and Ingeborg, all unmarried, are still living there.\\r\\nThey are all over fifty years of age now. Ole Stordok, who married\\r\\nAnne Sand from Rollaug, located at Sand Prairie, five miles south of\\r\\nBroadhead. In the same year came also Gullik O. Mygstue, with wife\\r\\nJöran and five children, from Vægli, Numedal. Gullik died in 1852, but\\r\\nthe widow lived till 1887. Their oldest son, Ole (born in 1825), had\\r\\nlearned the trade of a shoemaker and conducted a shoemaker\\'s shop on\\r\\nhis farm long after he had begun farming.[189] In 1848 he married Sive\\r\\nEspeset from Hallingdal, Norway; they had no children. [190]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [188] Aaen is said to have been something of an inventor. He made\\r\\n        two clocks, one of which was bought by Mr. Chrispinson; the\\r\\n        other was bought by Simon Strand, and is now probably in\\r\\n        the possession of Stone or Gunild Strand says a writer in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ for March 15th, 1907. Aaen died about 1886.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [189] The location of his farm is half a mile from Orfordville.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [190] Mrs. Mygstue died in 1892. Ole Mygstue then sold his farm and\\r\\n        moved to his sister, Mrs. Engen, in Primrose, Dane County. An\\r\\n        obituary notice of Ole Mygstue (who died in 1902) speaks very\\r\\n        highly of him as a member of the church and a citizen. He was\\r\\n        a man of kindly nature and helpful spirit in whom all reposed\\r\\n        implicit confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came from Numedal to America in 1842 was also Herbrand\\r\\nH. Berge (born in Rollaug in 1821). He remained for a year and a half\\r\\non Jefferson Prairie, however, so that he did not locate on Rock\\r\\nPrairie until early in 1844. Anna Torbjörnsdatter, who later became\\r\\nhis wife (1847) also immigrated in 1842. They removed to Jackson\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota, in 1876; he died there in December, 1903, and she in\\r\\nFebruary, 1904,[191] at the age of seventy-seven. In 1843 Hellik Olson\\r\\nHoltan with family from Flesberg in Numedal emigrated and settled on\\r\\nRock Prairie. Holtan was a man of much intelligence and strength of\\r\\ncharacter, who soon came to hold a leading place among the pioneers in\\r\\nthe community.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [191] Their children are: Paul Berge, Herbrand Berge and Mrs. Henry\\r\\n        Anderson, all living in Jackson, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far we have spoken only of immigrants from Numedal. In the year 1842\\r\\nthe first family from Land, Norway, came to Rock Prairie, namely Hans\\r\\nSmedsrud and wife. We have seen that the first immigrant from Land,\\r\\nLars Röste, who came in 1839, located at Rock Run. It was the year\\r\\n1843 which inaugurated the tide of emigration to America from Land and\\r\\nnearly all the earliest arrivals located on Rock Prairie. Thus in that\\r\\nyear came Harald Ommelstad and family, five in all, Anders Lundsæter\\r\\nand family, in all five, Peder H. Gaarder with family (six), Sören\\r\\nSörum, and Anne Marie Nilsdatter, in all eighteen persons. These were\\r\\nfollowed the next year by fifteen persons, namely: Lars Nord-Fossum\\r\\nand family (five), Hans Christofferson Tollefsrude and wife, Anders\\r\\nMidböen with wife and one child, Anders Engen, Gudbrand Gaarder, Helene\\r\\nGaarder, Inger Gaarder, and Helene Klevmoen. Anders Erstad and wife,\\r\\nand Syver Smed, who came at the same time, did not locate on Rock\\r\\nPrairie; the former went to Rock Run while Smed located at Wiota, being\\r\\nthe first native of Land to settle in La Fayette County.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall also add here the names of those who came from Land in the\\r\\nfollowing years. In 1845 came two families, namely Askild Ullensager,\\r\\nwife and four children, and Tarald Jörandlien, wife and four children.\\r\\nJörandlien or Jorlien, as the name is usually rendered, located\\r\\nin Newark. In 1846 Marie Engen and her son, Hans (born 1823) and\\r\\ndaughter, came, as did also Erik Nederhaugen. The year 1847 brought\\r\\nOle Nörstelien, Christine Nörstelien and Hans Sveum, wife and five\\r\\nchildren.[192] The year 1848 with its extensive immigration also\\r\\nbrought an increased contingent from Land. The following settled on\\r\\nRock Prairie; Ole Gaarder and wife, Andreas Sörum, Ingebrigt Fossum and\\r\\nfamily (six), Halvor Ruud and family (seven), Johans Nederhaugen[193]\\r\\nand family (four), Johan Frankrige and family (five) and Hovel\\r\\nJensvold,[194] Hovel Smeby and Bertha Lybæk.[195] In all there were\\r\\nfifty-four who came from Land in 1848; of these, twenty-eight settled\\r\\non Rock Prairie, twenty-five at Wiota and one at Rock Run. The roster\\r\\nof immigrants from Land in 1849 includes forty-eight persons, of whom\\r\\nsixteen located on Rock Prairie; they were: Johannes Ommelstadsæteren,\\r\\nIngeborg Ommelstadsæteren, Marthea Brendingen, Johans Lybæk, Bertha\\r\\nFröslie, Marit Fröslie, Hans Engen (Fröslieit) and family (five) and\\r\\nJonas Gjerdet and family (five). Syver Gaarder and family, thirteen in\\r\\nall, who located farther west at Albany, Green County, came directly\\r\\nfrom Land, but they were natives of Valders. He had moved from Valders\\r\\nto Torpen in Land and bought there the Gaarder farm when the Gaarder\\r\\nfamily emigrated in 1843, remaining there, however, as we have seen,\\r\\nonly six years.[196] The accessions for 1850 were: Ole Smeby and family\\r\\n(five), Östen Lundsæteren and family (five), Sjugal Frankrige and\\r\\nfamily (six), Helene Fröslie, Bertha Sörum, Hovel Fossum, Ole Hovdelien\\r\\nand Hans Værhaug, in all twenty-one.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [192] Svend Nörstelien and family (seven) and Kari Lillebæk and six\\r\\n        children from Land, who also came that year, settled in Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [193] Martin Johnson of Orfordville, Rock County, is his son.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [194] Christian Lunde, who also came from Land in 1848, located at\\r\\n        Rock Run. Several families went to Wiota; see above, Chapter\\r\\n        XXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [195] Who later married Syver Midböen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [196] Of the remaining twenty-three of this year\\'s immigration\\r\\n        from Land eleven went to Wiota, seven to Rock Run, and five\\r\\n        scattered elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe account of immigration from Land which it has been possible\\r\\nto give so fully here is based on the private records of Hans C.\\r\\nTollefsrude, as published in part in _Amerika_ for March 8th, 1907.\\r\\nHans Tollefsrude\\'s name occupies a foremost place in the early history\\r\\nof the Rock Prairie Settlement. In the seventies he again became a\\r\\npioneer, locating now in Pocahontas County, Iowa.[197]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [197] The limitations of space forbid a sketch of Mr. Tollefsrude\\r\\n        in our survey of Rock Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Immigration from Hallingdal, Norway, to Rock\\r\\n            Prairie from 1843 to 1848. Continued Immigration\\r\\n                 from Numedal. Other Early Accessions._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will now turn to another contingent in the early immigration to Rock\\r\\nPrairie,--that from the dialect district of Hallingdal. The emigration\\r\\nfrom this region began in 1842 with the departure of the brothers\\r\\nKnud and John Ellingson Solem, who came direct to Rock Prairie. In\\r\\n1843 Kleofas Halvorson Hansemoen immigrated with wife Kari (Onsgaard)\\r\\nand child Halvor, locating on section twelve in Newark Township, Rock\\r\\nCounty.[198] Kleofas\\'s father\\'s name was Halvor Kleofasen Hansemoen;\\r\\nhe did not emigrate. There were two other brothers, Erik and Hans, of\\r\\nwhom the former did not come to this country. Hans Hansemoen had in\\r\\nNorway bought an estate called Husemoen, not intending to emigrate.\\r\\nBut when his brother sent favorable reports back from America, he sold\\r\\nout and came to this country in the fall of 1845. He bought land in\\r\\nsections eleven and twelve in Newark Township, near his brother. The\\r\\nabove is narrated in part to show how his name happens to appear as\\r\\nHans Husemoen, while the brother is Kleofas Hansemoen and the brother\\'s\\r\\nchildren are Halvor Kleofas, Knud Kleofas, etc. (see note 198). Hans\\r\\nHusemoen\\'s wife\\'s maiden name was Bergit Halvorsdatter Tveto; she was\\r\\nfrom Aal Parish in Hallingdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [198] They had five children in this country: Knud, Kleofas,\\r\\n        Eyvind, Eirik and Caroline, all now married and with\\r\\n        families. The sons adopted Cleofas as the family name. The\\r\\n        daughter was married to Kittil Haugen, now living in Pelican\\r\\n        Rapids, Minn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1845 the settlement received other accessions from Hallingdal. The\\r\\nlist includes: Ola Brunsvold, Halvor Hesgard, Kristen Grimsgaard,\\r\\nOle Skaalen, Nils Roe, Ola Sando, Mikkel Rust, Svend Hesla, Gjermund\\r\\nMæhtum, Aslak Rustad and Aslak Ulsak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 about three hundred persons emigrated from Hallingdal. How many\\r\\nof these came to Rock County I am not able to say; among them were,\\r\\nhowever, Erik Kolsrud and family, Ole Hei and family, Nils Haugen,\\r\\nwife and six children, Knud Tröstem, Henrik Henriksen Tröstem, Halvor\\r\\nNess, Hans Engen, Kari Husemoen, Guttorm Roen and son, Ole, Tollef\\r\\nTollefsrud-Ballandby and sons Nils, Ola and Amund, Henrik Rime, brother\\r\\nof Tollef, A. T. Beigo, Timan Burtness and his brother John, Aadne\\r\\nEngen, Kristen Megaarden, Lars Grimsgaard, wife and family, Ingeborg\\r\\nOlsdatter Tröstem, Asle Hesla, and Asle Brunsvold. Many of the above\\r\\nhad families. The leaders of this party were the three first named and\\r\\nTollef Tollefsrude. They were the owners of large estates in Norway\\r\\nwhich they sold when they left for America. They paid the passage for\\r\\nmany who came from Hallingdal that summer, but I cannot give the names\\r\\nof these. The party of emigrants left Drammen in April by the ship\\r\\n_Newmann_, which took them to Havre, France. Here they remained one\\r\\nmonth, before the ship on which they were to sail was gotten ready.\\r\\nThey did not arrive to Rock Prairie until October, having been six\\r\\nmonths en route.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1847 very few came from Hallingdal, among them are mentioned Ole\\r\\nOnsgaard, Nils O. Wikko,[199] and Östen Burtness. In the following\\r\\nyear, however, there was a considerable immigration. Erik K. Berg and\\r\\nhis brother Truls Berg, Ole Trulson Ve and Ole Gulsen (Tröstem) with\\r\\nwife and son Gul and daughter Guri, Erik Ovestrud, Tideman Kvarve,\\r\\nGuttorm Megaarden, a Mr. Sagdalen and wife, Kari,[200] Levor Kvarve\\r\\nand family of twelve, and Knut Guttormsen Tyrebakken.[201] There came\\r\\nothers from Hallingdal also in the years following. I may mention\\r\\nhere Ole J. Bakke and wife and Herbrand K. Finseth (born in Hemsedal\\r\\nin July, 1830), who emigrated in 1852 and lived three years on Rock\\r\\nPrairie. They moved to Goodhue County, Minnesota, in 1855, as did also\\r\\nKnut K. Finseth and A. K. Finseth, brothers of Herbrand; these together\\r\\nwith Halvor Hesgard, Aadne Engen and Christen Evenson, who removed to\\r\\nMinnesota at the same time, were the first white settlers in the Town\\r\\nof Holden, Goodhue County.[202] I may also mention Kittel O. Ruud, born\\r\\n1823 of parents Erik Sanderson and Margit Ruud, and who came to Rock\\r\\nCounty in 1850. A few years later he moved to Northwestern Iowa and in\\r\\n1855 became a pioneer settler in Holdon, Goodhue County, Minnesota,\\r\\nwhere he married Margrethe Andersdatter Flom in 1856. She was born in\\r\\nAurland, Sogn, 1824. She died in March and he in April, 1903.[203]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [199] Nils O. Wikko was from Gol, Hallingdal. He married Beret\\r\\n        Halvorson in 1854, and removed soon after to Worth County,\\r\\n        Iowa. He died in 1904, at the age of eighty-three, survived\\r\\n        by widow and six daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [200] They moved to Houston County, Minnesota, in 1853. He died in\\r\\n        1894 and she in 1904, at the age of eighty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [201] Tyrebakken moved to Black Hammer, Minnesota, in 1854, when he\\r\\n        married Mari Haugejordet. He was born in 1823, in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [202] Knut Finseth died in 1869. Herbrand Finseth married Guri\\r\\n        Ouri in 1867; he died in January, 1901, leaving wife and six\\r\\n        children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [203] I gather these facts from an obituary notice, which speaks at\\r\\n        length in eloquent terms of the noble lives of this couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigrants from Hallingdal settled chiefly in Spring Valley, and\\r\\nPlymouth; Beloit and Newark townships were settled for the most part\\r\\nbefore the Hallingdal immigrants began to come in larger numbers,\\r\\nyet some are located in Beloit Township. Newark is occupied largely\\r\\nby immigrants from Numedal, as is also Beloit. While Rock Prairie\\r\\nwas taken possession of chiefly by pioneers from Numedal, Land,\\r\\nand Hallingdal, there were also a few from Telemarken, Sigdal and\\r\\nRingerike, and one from Valders among the pioneers of the forties.\\r\\nOf those who came from Telemarken I shall mention Knut Simon (born\\r\\n1819), who located near Janesville in 1843. He removed to Rice County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1854, and thence to Pope County in 1865; died in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single immigrant from Valders to locate on Rock Prairie was Guul\\r\\nGuttormson. He came in 1843 and is the first known American immigrant\\r\\nfrom that district. He was born at Ildjernstadhaug in Hedalen in 1816.\\r\\nAbout 1840 he had removed to Modum; here a copy of Nattestad\\'s journal\\r\\nfell into his hands and he and Hans Uhlen and Anders Aamodt[204]\\r\\ndecided to emigrate. These three came on the same ship that brought\\r\\nKleofas Halvorson and Peder Gaarder. Guttormson bought land half way\\r\\nbetween Orfordville and Broadhead. He was always called \"Guul Valdris\"\\r\\nfor he was and remained the only \"Valdris\"[205] there, for while he\\r\\nwrote home urging his friends in Valders to come to America, the\\r\\nimmigration from Valders did not set in before 1847-48 and by that time\\r\\nRock Prairie had been, as we have seen, taken up largely by immigrants\\r\\nfrom Hallingdal and Land. Guul Guttormson\\'s oldest son, Guttorm Guul\\r\\n(Broadhead, Wisconsin), born August, 1848, was probably the first child\\r\\nborn of Valdris parentage in America. I have already spoken of the\\r\\nemigration of Syver Gaarder,[206] a \"Valdris\" who came with the party\\r\\nfrom Land in 1849. They located at Albany in Green County. These I\\r\\nbelieve were the only settlers from Valders in this locality.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [204] These two were the first to emigrate to America from Modum.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [205] Valdris is the Norwegian appellation of a native of Valders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [206] Syver Gaarder\\'s daughter, Barbro, married Martin Johnson\\r\\n        (Nederhaugen) in 1855. Dr. J. S. Johnson, of Minneapolis,\\r\\n        is their oldest son; other children are: Ben Johnson,\\r\\n        Orfordville, Wisconsin; Mrs. Rev. Langseth, Glendorado,\\r\\n        Minn.; Mrs. Rev. L. Njus, McIntosh, Minn.; Mrs. Strömseth,\\r\\n        living on the homestead; Mandy Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Economic Conditions of Immigrants. Cost of Passage.\\r\\n                    Course of the Journey. Duration\\r\\n                            of the Journey._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn discussing the causes of emigration, we have found that economic\\r\\nfactors entered extensively into operation. It was the desire for\\r\\nmaterial betterment that prompted a very large proportion of Norwegian\\r\\nemigrants to leave the land of their fathers. The first five decades\\r\\nof Norwegian emigration was a period in which the battle for existence\\r\\namong the Norwegian peasant and the common man was none too easy.\\r\\nUnfavorable economic conditions, the oppressive methods of the\\r\\nlarger land owners, frequent crop failure, often reduced the lesser\\r\\nfarmers into a condition of impoverishment. Even wealthy families\\r\\nfound themselves burdened by debts from which the future seemed to\\r\\noffer little hope of relief. By the law of primogeniture the oldest\\r\\nson inherited the estate. The sons of men of means, therefore, were\\r\\nfinancially often no better situated than the cotter\\'s son, and were\\r\\noften forced to seek their fortune beyond the native village or\\r\\ndistrict. These considerations will make clear first that the great\\r\\nmajority of Norwegian emigrants to the United States were at the time\\r\\nof emigration of small means; they were often very poor indeed. Their\\r\\nwealth lay in the ability and the will to carve their way in a land\\r\\nof greater promise. Their wealth lay also in their thrift, in their\\r\\nideals, and the moral fiber of their race. Many of those who have\\r\\nsucceeded best in their adopted country came here well-nigh penniless.\\r\\nTo them poverty was no longer a curse when the path of opportunity lay\\r\\nbefore them. But the above considerations will also have indicated\\r\\nthat Norwegian immigrants of that early period were not always of the\\r\\npoor classes even though they came here with little or nothing. Later\\r\\nNorwegian immigration has, it is true, generally been from among the\\r\\nimpecunious. But in that early period, especially 1835 to 1865, a very\\r\\nlarge number of the immigrants came from families which general or\\r\\nspecial conditions had suddenly so reduced to conditions which became\\r\\nto them intolerable. And it was the hope which America held out which\\r\\ninspired them with the will to seek there the independence now no\\r\\nlonger theirs. We have already met with the evidence of this in such\\r\\nfamilies as Hovland (1835), Nattestad (1837), Aadland (1837), Aasland\\r\\n(1838), Gravdal (1839), Stabæk (1839), Gitle Danielson (1839), Luraas\\r\\n(1839), Unde (1839), Heg (1840), Gaarder (1843-49), Nils Haugen (1846),\\r\\nand many others. We shall in the following pages meet with families\\r\\nof considerable means from Numedal, Telemarken, Voss, Ringsaker and\\r\\nelsewhere, of whom the same is true; and among the pioneers who came\\r\\nfrom Sogn in 1844, 1845, and later there were many old families of\\r\\nproperty and prominence in their native community. I stress this fact\\r\\nbecause some who have formerly written about Norwegian settlements in\\r\\nthis country have never yet fully recognized the full significance\\r\\nof this; but I speak of it here especially because I have myself\\r\\nalso failed to fully appreciate this fact when last I wrote upon\\r\\nthe subject. What has been said here applies to the founders of the\\r\\nsettlements of Northern Illinois, of Racine, Rock, Dane and other\\r\\ncounties in Southern Wisconsin, and many of those who some years later\\r\\nestablished the settlements in Northern Iowa and Southern Minnesota.\\r\\nOn the other hand also some of those who later became most substantial\\r\\nmembers of these settlements were men whose transportation to America\\r\\nwas paid for by others that they might come and get a start in life.\\r\\nThese men emigrated prompted by the desire of material betterment and\\r\\nin that aim they have succeeded, and they have succeeded honestly,\\r\\noften accumulating great wealth.[207]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [207] It is only \"financial prosperity\" which we are here speaking\\r\\n        of, of course. The question of \"success\" is entirely a\\r\\n        different one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second topic in the title of this chapter is the cost of passage. I\\r\\nshall discuss this item briefly, using concrete illustrations from our\\r\\nsources. In that early period the voyage was made by sail-ships. These\\r\\ncontinued to be used for a long time after steam had come into use,\\r\\nclear down into the seventies. The ticket was then generally somewhat\\r\\ncheaper by sailing vessels than by steamship. Passengers furnished\\r\\ntheir own board and beading, and they were required to bring a supply\\r\\nsufficient for ten to twelve weeks.[208] The price of passage ranged\\r\\nbetween 33 and 50 _speciedaler_, that is between $25.00 and $38.00.\\r\\nChildren under fourteen travelled for half price; those under one went\\r\\nfree. The Luraas party (page 158 above) paid forty-two _speciedaler_\\r\\nfrom Gothenburg to Boston, while the Nattestad party paid fifty dollars\\r\\nfrom Gothenburg to New York in 1837. In 1839 the party that came with\\r\\nAnsten Nattestad secured passage for thirty-three dollars per person.\\r\\nThis may be regarded as normal; it was the price paid, e. g., by\\r\\nAnders Tömmerstigen and family from Christiania via Havre, France,\\r\\nto New York in 1846. Those who came in June from Sogn in 1844 paid\\r\\ntwenty-five dollars a person from Bergen to New York. The extremes are\\r\\nillustrated by two groups for the year 1839 and 1845: The little group\\r\\nof immigrants who came from Stavanger via Gothenburg to Boston with\\r\\nGitle Danielson in 1839 paid, it seems, sixty dollars apiece,[209]\\r\\nwhile Peder Aasmundson Tanger and others, ninety in all, who came in\\r\\n1845 from Kragerö, paid only eighteen dollars apiece to New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [208] The regulations varying with different ships, _Juno_, which\\r\\n        brought the first party from Inner Sogn in 1844, did not\\r\\n        accept any passenger who had not provided himself with food\\r\\n        supply for twelve weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [209] i. e. $47. R. B. Anderson\\'s _First Chapter_, page 313.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inland journey, generally in the early days made by canal boat,\\r\\nvaried greatly in cost, often amounting to as much as fourteen dollars\\r\\nto Milwaukee or Chicago. But the additional toll inland frequently\\r\\nmade the inland journey much more expensive than was the ocean voyage.\\r\\nOne pioneer, writing of this later, says that his whole journey cost\\r\\nhim ninety dollars.[210] In the fifties the inland journey was made by\\r\\nrailroad; the railroad ticket from Quebec to Chicago or Milwaukee was\\r\\neight dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [210] In American money, of which less than half for the ocean voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of the journey has been incidentally indicated above.\\r\\nDuring the first years it was usually by way of Gothenburg, sometimes\\r\\nvia Hamburg, not infrequently by way of Havre. The starting point was\\r\\nStavanger, Bergen, Skien, Drammen, Porsgrund and Christiania, later\\r\\nother ports. New York was most often the place of landing, but not\\r\\ninfrequently Boston, in isolated instances, Fall River, Philadelphia\\r\\nand New Orleans. After 1850 sail-ships plied extensively between\\r\\nScandinavian ports and Quebec.[211] The inland journey from New York\\r\\nwent by steamboat to Albany, thence by canal boat to Buffalo, a\\r\\ndistance of three hundred and fifty miles, which usually took twelve\\r\\ndays but often over two weeks.[212] From Buffalo the journey went\\r\\nby steamboat over the Great Lakes to Milwaukee and Chicago, after\\r\\n1842 usually to Milwaukee. Those who took the Quebec route after 1850\\r\\nwere then brought to St. Levi by the railroad company\\'s steamboats,\\r\\nwhence they went by rail to Chicago or Milwaukee,[213] a journey which\\r\\ngenerally took four or five days,[214] over a distance of 1020 miles.\\r\\nMilwaukee-bound passengers were often shipped from Port Huron by way\\r\\nof Lakes Huron and Michigan or were taken by rail from Detroit across\\r\\nMichigan to Grand Haven, thence by steamboat across Lake Michigan to\\r\\nMilwaukee.[215] The latter was of course the shorter and the favored\\r\\nroute for immigrants whose destination was Wisconsin, Northern Iowa, or\\r\\nMinnesota. Immigrants who landed in Boston usually went by steamboat\\r\\nthence to New York and from the regular inland route as given above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [211] Of the trials and the hardships of the ocean voyage in\\r\\n        the thirties, forties and fifties, we can to-day have no\\r\\n        conception. It would, however, fall outside the scope\\r\\n        of this work to discuss that here. I may refer the\\r\\n        reader to a well-written article by H. Cock Jensen in\\r\\n        _Nordmandsforbundet_, December, 1907, pages 53-66. See also\\r\\n        Holand\\'s article, pages 56-60.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [212] A good account of the character of this journey is given by\\r\\n        Holand, pages 65-74.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [213] Via Montreal, Toronto, Port Huron and Detroit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [214] _Billed-Magazin_ I, 123-124, article \"Om Udvandringen,\" by J.\\r\\n        A. Johnson Skipsnes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [215] To Port Huron 189 miles, thence to Milwaukee 85 miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duration of the journey was always a matter of great uncertainty.\\r\\nIntending emigrants who came from the interior of Norway often had to\\r\\nwait as long as two weeks at Bergen or Skien, as the case might be,\\r\\nbefore the ships on which they were to go sailed. The overhauling and\\r\\nputting in repair of the storm-battered ships often took weeks.[216]\\r\\nThe duration of the voyage across the Atlantic depended of course\\r\\nlargely upon the state of the weather. With this favorable a sail-boat\\r\\nwould usually cross the ocean in six or seven weeks,[217] but in a\\r\\nvoyage of such a distance it was practically certain that there would\\r\\nbe stormy weather sometime before the other side was reached. In his\\r\\nanswer to this question in _Billed-Magazin_ I, page 123, John A.\\r\\nJohnson wrote that the average length was seven weeks, but he adds that\\r\\nthose who crossed in that time had no reason to complain. And he speaks\\r\\nof the fact that emigrant ships have in rare cases taken twelve to\\r\\nthirteen weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [216] The author\\'s grandfather, Ole Torjussen Flom, and party of\\r\\n        about fifty-three, from Inner Sogn, were obliged to wait in\\r\\n        Bergen nearly three weeks before sailing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [217] There was of course great difference in the speed of the\\r\\n        boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nattestad party made, in 1837, an especially short voyage of\\r\\nthirty-two days from Gothenburg to Fall River. I have no record of\\r\\nany other ship in those early years which sailed so well as did\\r\\n_Enigheden_. _Juno_, the most rapid sailer on the Atlantic in the\\r\\nforties, crossed in five weeks and three days in May-June, 1844, which\\r\\nKristi Melaas of Stoughton, Wisconsin, who was a passenger, says broke\\r\\nthe record for speed at that time. Ansten Nattestad and party took\\r\\nnine weeks in 1839 with the ship _Emelia_ from Drammen. Nine weeks\\r\\nis the number which many report as the duration of the voyage in the\\r\\nforties. The party that came with the Luraas brothers from Tin and\\r\\nGitle Danielson from Stavanger also in 1839 took nine weeks and three\\r\\ndays from Gothenburg to Boston. And _Aegir_ took nine weeks on its\\r\\njourney from Bergen to New York in 1837. The sloop _Restaurationen_ we\\r\\nrecall crossed in ten weeks. The so-called Brook-ship _Albion_ usually\\r\\nrequired from eight to nine weeks for the voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn stormy weather the voyage sometimes lasted as much as fourteen\\r\\nweeks. The sail-ship _Tricolor_ took that long in April-July, 1845, the\\r\\nroute being from Porsgrund to New York. Ingebrigt Johnson Helle, from\\r\\nKragerö, who was a passenger, writes of the terrors of this journey\\r\\n(see appendix 2). On a voyage made in 1848 _Tricolor_ took fourteen\\r\\nweeks and four days, according to interview with Kari Gulliksdatter\\r\\nMogen (from Flesberg, Numedal), who was a passenger on the ship\\r\\n(see _Billed-Magazin_ I, page 388). The little sail-ship in which\\r\\nNils Hansen Fjeld and family came in 1847 took fourteen weeks from\\r\\nChristiania to New York.[218]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [218] For account of the voyage see Appendix 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection I shall cite from an article by Dr. K. M. Teigen of\\r\\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, entitled \"Pionerliv\" (Pioneer Life).[219] He\\r\\nsays:\\r\\n\\r\\n  In the days of the sail-ship a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean\\r\\n  was more of an undertaking than a journey around the world now.\\r\\n  Most of the summer might be required for it if the weather was\\r\\n  unfavorable. My mother\\'s party from Flesberg and Lyngdal parishes\\r\\n  in Numedal, took seven weeks and four days in 1843 with the brig\\r\\n  _Hercules_, Captain Overvind, between Drammen and New York; my\\r\\n  father\\'s company from Sogndal in Inner Sogn, three years later, lay\\r\\n  for fourteen weeks heaving and lunging in contrary winds between\\r\\n  Bergen and the promised land. And then came the journey by steamer\\r\\n  up the Hudson to Troy, thence through the \"canal\" and the sluices\\r\\n  at Oswego by canal boats, which were drawn with a snail\\'s pace by\\r\\n  horses, lazily moving along the banks; then by way of the lakes\\r\\n  by steamer again westward to Milwaukee. For this journey of about\\r\\n  a thousand miles another month went by, without counting the walk\\r\\n  from Milwaukee to Koshkonong, lying seventy miles distant in the\\r\\n  wilderness, whither so many of the earliest Norwegian immigrants\\r\\n  were destined.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [219] The article forms one in a series of most interesting\\r\\n        articles bearing the general title \"Blandt Vestens Vikinger\"\\r\\n        (\\'Mongst the Vikings of the West) printed in _Amerika_ in\\r\\n        1901 and 1902. Dr. Teigen, son of O. C. Teigen, Koshkonong\\r\\n        Pioneer of 1846, is a poet and story writer of the first rank\\r\\n        among Norwegians in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the place of landing the immigrants were frequently obliged to\\r\\nwait for several days before the westward journey was begun. To Rock\\r\\nPrairie, Koshkonong or Norway Grove, as the case might be, required\\r\\nanother week, and correspondingly more for those bound for more\\r\\nwesterly settlements. In all the duration of the journey from Norway\\r\\nto the settlement which was the immigrant\\'s ultimate destination was\\r\\nrarely made in less than nine weeks; often it consumed as much as five\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n          _Norwegians in Chicago, 1840-1845. A Vossing Colony.\\r\\n            Some Early Settlers in Chicago from Hardanger._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page 94 above I have spoken briefly of the first Norwegian settlers\\r\\nin Chicago in the years 1836-1839. On page 150 mention was made of the\\r\\nincrease of the Chicago colony by the arrival of a number of immigrants\\r\\nfrom Voss, Norway, in 1839-41. As there indicated, however, many of\\r\\nthose who came during these years lived there only temporarily; we find\\r\\nthem later as pioneers elsewhere, especially in Dane and La Fayette\\r\\nCounties, Wisconsin.[220] The same applies also to several of those who\\r\\ncame from Voss, Sogn, and Telemarken, to Chicago in 1843-1844;[221]\\r\\nthese went mostly to Koshkonong, Wiota or Long Prairie, others to the\\r\\nvarious parts of the Fox River settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [220] I instance the families of Th. Saue and Kvelve who went to\\r\\n        Koshkonong, and Unde, Ulven, Skjerveim and Vinje who went to\\r\\n        Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [221] For instance the Kaasa family went to Long Prairie in 1845.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chapter XXI above I have further related some incidents from the\\r\\nlife of some early Norwegian settlers in Chicago. In the following\\r\\npages I shall merely try to give a brief account of new accessions to\\r\\nthe Chicago colony between the years 1842 and 1850. It is estimated\\r\\nthat there were in Chicago in 1850 3,000 persons of Norwegian birth;\\r\\nrelatively the number was therefore considerable in that year. Yet I\\r\\nshall probably be right if I say that the actual number of Norwegians\\r\\nin the city in the year 1842 was very small, not more than in some of\\r\\nthe smallest rural settlements already established. I assume that as\\r\\nthe early Norwegian immigrants came here with the intention of settling\\r\\non a farm, comparatively very few were induced to remain permanently\\r\\nin Chicago. Chicago and vicinity was not particularly inviting at the\\r\\ntime; the swamps and marshes soon drove the incoming immigrants to the\\r\\nmore inviting and the far more fertile inland counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs residents of Chicago before 1839, we have found Halstein Torison,\\r\\nJohan Larson, Nils Röthe and wife Torbjör, Svein Knutson Lothe and\\r\\nwife and two children, Baard Johnson, wife and five children, Andrew\\r\\nNilson Brække and Anders Larsen Flage, both with families; these were\\r\\nall from Voss except Johan Larsen, a sailor who was from Kopervik,\\r\\na little south of Haugesund, and Torison, who was from Fjeldberg in\\r\\nSöndhordland.[222] Among Baard Johnson\\'s sons were Anfin, John and\\r\\nAndrew; the first of these was a tailor in the employ of Simon Doyle\\r\\non Kinzie Street.[223] The first directory of Chicago, published in\\r\\n1839, gives a few more names of Norwegians.[224] We know that Lars\\r\\nDavidson Reque lived there then; he seems to have lived in the Cass\\r\\nStreet Dutch settlement. His occupation was that of a fireman on the\\r\\nsteamboat _George W. Dole_. There were two other Davidsons, Sivert[225]\\r\\nand Peter; in the latter we recognize our Per Davidson Skjerveim (see\\r\\nabove p. 199). Other names in the same directory are: Asle Anderson,\\r\\nmusician; Endre Anderson, laborer; Eric Anderson, pressman; all three\\r\\nof whom lived at the same house on North State Street, and were\\r\\nprobably brothers; Canute Lawson (Larson), city street carpenter and\\r\\nIver Lawson, who lived at 240 Superior Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [222] The Newberry, whom Torrison worked for as a gardener was the\\r\\n        founder of well-known Newberry Library.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [223] For this and many other facts in this chapter I am indebted\\r\\n        to Strand\\'s _History_, pages 182-186.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [224] A. E. Strand published some facts from this directory on\\r\\n        pages 183-184 of his work.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [225] He was a carpenter. Mr. Strand thinks the three were\\r\\n        brothers. This is a mistake of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the directory does not give the name of another Norwegian who, if\\r\\nthe year of his arrival is correctly recorded, must have been the first\\r\\nScandinavian resident of Chicago, namely David Johnson, who came in\\r\\n1834. He was a pressman in the employ of Mr. Calhoun, the publisher\\r\\nof _The Chicago Democrat_. David Johnson was a sailor, who came from\\r\\nNorway to New York as a boy, locating in New York in 1832, securing\\r\\nwork as a press-feeder. About this time Mr. Calhoun was planning to\\r\\ninstall a cylinder press in place of the old hand press at his printing\\r\\nestablishment in Chicago. The cylinder press was ordered from New York,\\r\\nMr. Johnson having accepted Calhoun\\'s offer as pressman for him, he\\r\\nwent to Chicago at the same time, where he put up and operated the\\r\\nnew press. The Chicago Historical Society has among its documents Mr.\\r\\nCalhoun\\'s account-book for 1834, which gives Mr. Johnson\\'s name.[226]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [226] Strand\\'s _History_, p. 187.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were other Norwegians in Chicago in 1839 who do not seem to\\r\\nhave been found by the census taker. Thus Steffen K. Gilderhus came\\r\\nthere from Voss in 1838 and his brother Ole K. Gilderhus came in 1839.\\r\\nThey lived in Chicago until 1844, when they settled on Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie, Dane County, Wisconsin. Further Per Unde, Sjur Ulven and Arne\\r\\nVinje who came there in 1839; these three settled at Wiota, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin 1841. Of this removal I have given a full account above chapter.\\r\\nProbably the earliest subsequent arrival from Voss were Torstein Saue,\\r\\nwife and son Gulleik, who came in the summer of 1840. They lived in\\r\\nChicago until 1843, when they also went to Koshkonong. At about the\\r\\nsame time of the year came also Baard Nyre, Mads Sanve, Ole Gilbertson,\\r\\nBrynjulf Ronve, Klaus Grimestad and wife and Lars T. Röthe and Anna\\r\\nBakketun, all from Voss, and all of whom were for some time residents\\r\\nof Chicago. Anna Bakketun married a Mr. Nicholson (Nikolausen), who\\r\\ndied from cholera in 1849. From this marriage there were two sons,\\r\\nHenry Nicholson, who served throughout the war, and John G. Nicholson,\\r\\nwho is still living (Orchard Street). Torstein Michaelson, who\\r\\nsucceeded Halstein Torison in the employ of Newberry, also came in\\r\\n1840 or 1841. Michaelson was from Voss where he was born in 1808; he\\r\\nremained Newberry\\'s gardener for about thirty-five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have above seen that some of the early immigrants to Illinois were\\r\\nfrom Hardanger, Norway, but the number was not large. We shall speak\\r\\nof this immigration more in detail in connection with the settlement\\r\\nof Lee County, Illinois. Here it will be in order now to note briefly\\r\\nHardanger\\'s contribution to the Norwegian colony in Chicago in the\\r\\nperiod under discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1839 twenty-two persons emigrated from Ulvik Parish, Hardanger,\\r\\nand all of these came to Chicago. They were: Gunnar Tveito, wife and\\r\\nchild; Anders Vik, Johan Vik, Brynjulf Lekve, Lars Torblaa, wife\\r\\nand two children, Nils Vambheim and wife, Olav L. Mo, wife and two\\r\\ndaughters and Lars Spilde, wife and four children.[227] This party\\r\\nhaving started out from Bergen left Gothenburg May 27, landed at Fall\\r\\nRiver, Massachusetts, August 2, took boat to New York, thence via\\r\\nBuffalo to Chicago, where they arrived August 25.[228] In Chicago\\r\\nthey suffered much hardship, many were taken sick and died, among the\\r\\nlatter Tveito\\'s and Vambheim\\'s wives. The men secured work, some on\\r\\nthe canal, some on a schooner on the river, others as wood-cutters in\\r\\nthe forests about Chicago. Lekve and the two Vik brothers wrote an\\r\\naccount of their trials which was published in _Bergens Stiftstidende_\\r\\nfor June 11, 1841, in which they advised against emigrating to America,\\r\\nand as a result there was no immigration to this country from Hardanger\\r\\nagain before 1846-1847. Very few of the later immigrants from Hardanger\\r\\nlocated in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [227] Facts gathered from _Normandsforbundet_ II, where Rev.\\r\\n        O. Olofson of Ullensvang, Hardanger, discusses most\\r\\n        interestingly the early emigration from Hardanger to America\\r\\n        (pp. 169-180).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [228] The Chicago census for 1839 does not include the names of any\\r\\n        of this party.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther arrivals during subsequent years were: 1841, Peter Nelson and\\r\\nKnut Larson Bö; 1842, J. C. Anderson, and in 1843, Ole Kaasa and\\r\\nfamily, G. A. Wigeland, Nils Bakketun and Randver Lydvo (b. 1813). Ole\\r\\nKaasa moved from Chicago to Boone County, in 1845, but one of his sons,\\r\\nJens, became a permanent resident of Chicago and a leading member of\\r\\nthe Norwegian colony of Chicago during his life. Jens Olson, as he was\\r\\nknown, was born in 1824 in Siljord, Upper Telemarken. In the early part\\r\\nof 1840 the family moved to Bamble Parish in Lower Telemarken, whence\\r\\nthey emigrated in 1843. They arrived in Chicago October 20 of that\\r\\nyear. The brother, Thore Olson, went out to Boone County; Jens settled\\r\\npermanently in Chicago, where he lived till his death in 1907. In 1853\\r\\nhe married Martha Anderson[229] at Capron, Illinois.[230]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [229] She was born in 1827 at Stökebö in Levanger Parish, Diocese\\r\\n        of Bergen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [230] Mrs. Jens Olson died in 1895.\\r\\n\\r\\nJens Olson was a master mason and brick-layer, and he built Vor\\r\\nFrelsers Kirke[231] the corner of Erie and May Streets. Later he became\\r\\na contractor on a larger scale and erected a large number of school\\r\\nhouses in Chicago. He was an ardent supporter of the Lutheran church\\r\\nand gave freely to its cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [231] Our Savior\\'s Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandver Lydvo[232] came to Chicago in October, 1843. In June, 1844,\\r\\nshe was married to Lars Knutson Dykesten; the ceremony took place in\\r\\nNils Röthe\\'s house and the ceremony was performed by Rev. Flavel Bascum\\r\\nof the First Presbyterian church. Lars Knutson died in the cholera\\r\\nepidemic in 1849. Mrs. Knutson who is still living[233] is one of the\\r\\noldest Norwegian residents of Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [232] She was the daughter of Anders Knutson Lydvo and wife, Martha\\r\\n        (Röthe). Anders Lydvo died in 1860 and Martha in 1875.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [233] She resides with her daughter, Mrs. Louis H. Johnson, at 235\\r\\n        Watt Avenue, Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844 Bryngel Henderson and wife Martha came to Chicago and became\\r\\npermanent residents of the city, as did also Knut Iverson Glimme, Mrs.\\r\\nJulia Nelson, Ellef G. Severtson[234] and John A. Hefte. These were\\r\\nall from Voss; Severtson was from Vossevangen. Ole Bakketun and family\\r\\nand Sjur M. Sære, also with family, both from Voss, came to Chicago in\\r\\n1844, but lived there only one year, when they went to Koshkonong.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [234] Ellev G. Seavert.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1844 also brought Chicago another permanent resident from\\r\\nVoss, who later became prominently associated with the commercial\\r\\nand political life of the city. This was Iver Larson Bö, born 1821,\\r\\nin Voss, Norway, who came to Chicago that year and not as generally\\r\\nfound stated in or about 1840,[235] locating on the north side. Iver\\r\\ndropped the surname Bö, and changed Larson to Lawson, so that his\\r\\nname became Iver Lawson. He was one of the organizers of the First\\r\\nLutheran church in 1848, located at that time on Superior Street\\r\\nbetween Wells Street and La Salle Avenue.[236] Lawson took a prominent\\r\\npart in the political life of early Chicago, e.g., as member of the\\r\\ncity council, and otherwise. In 1869 he was a member of the House of\\r\\nRepresentatives in the State Legislature. As legislator his name is\\r\\nmost closely associated with the establishment of Chicago\\'s excellent\\r\\nsystem of parks; the creation of Lincoln Park in particular was due\\r\\nin great measure to Lawson\\'s efforts.[237] Iver Lawson\\'s name is also\\r\\nassociated with that of John Anderson in the founding of _Skandinaven_,\\r\\nnow the largest and most widely circulated Norwegian newspaper in this\\r\\ncountry.[238]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [235] So Strand, and after him Roland, p. 101.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [236] Strand, page 217.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [237] Brought out by Strand\\'s investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [238] V. F. Lawson was also the owner of _The Chicago Record_\\r\\n        before the _Record_ and the _Herald_ were combined about year\\r\\n        1898.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1845 brought a number of accessions to the Norwegian colony of\\r\\nChicago. Among them Kittil Nirison, from Bö Parish in Telemarken, one\\r\\nof the few from Telemarken who settled in Chicago in the early days,\\r\\nKnud K. Harrisville and wife Maren Karine (née Larson), Christian Lee,\\r\\nfrom Gausdal, and Andrew Anderson, wife, Laura, and family from Voss.\\r\\nThis family included a son John, born March, 1836, who is the well\\r\\nknown founder and owner of _Skandinaven_ and president of the John A.\\r\\nAnderson Publishing Company.[239]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Anderson died of the cholera in 1849, and to the son John,\\r\\nthen thirteen years old, fell the task of supporting his mother and\\r\\nbaby sister, which he did at first by peddling apples and carrying\\r\\nnewspapers. Then he became \"printer\\'s devil\" and soon learned the\\r\\nart of distributing and setting type.[240] In the following years he\\r\\nwas successively connected with _The Argus_, _The Democratic Press_\\r\\nand _The Press-Tribune_. In 1866 he launched a paper of his own,\\r\\n_Skandinaven_, which at first a small sheet issued weekly has grown\\r\\nuntil, through its daily, semi-weekly and weekly issue, it is now the\\r\\nlargest and politically the most influential of Norwegian newspapers\\r\\nin the country. Mr. Anderson has engaged extensively in the publishing\\r\\nof books, issuing a far larger number of books a year than any other\\r\\nNorwegian-American publisher. In this connection it is to be especially\\r\\nmentioned that he has also in recent years done excellent pioneer\\r\\nwork in the publishing of certain educational works, as school and\\r\\ncollege texts of Norwegian literature, thereby facilitating materially\\r\\ninstruction in this field in our colleges and universities.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [239] There were three sons, but one died at sea, and another died\\r\\n        on the journey from Albany to Buffalo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [240] Strand\\'s _History_, page 266.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn succeeding years the Norwegian colony in Chicago grew rapidly.\\r\\nAlready in 1850 it was considerable; to-day there are more Norwegians\\r\\nin Chicago than any other city in the country (see also footnote 443).\\r\\nThey resided in the early days for the most part on the north side,\\r\\nsouth of Chicago Avenue, between the lake and the present Orleans\\r\\nStreet. Later the region of Wicker Park became a Norwegian center.\\r\\nTo-day they are found very extensively in the vicinity of Humboldt Park\\r\\nand Logan Square, the business center is along West North Avenue.[241]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [241] Strand, p. 180. See also above page 50.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the earliest Norwegian settlers of Chicago now living is to be\\r\\nmentioned finally Mrs. Martha Erickson who come to this country in\\r\\n1841. She is the daughter of Björn Björnson, who accompanied Kleng\\r\\nPeerson to America in 1825. For account of this see above page 50. The\\r\\nother twin, there referred to came to America in 1866; her name is Mrs.\\r\\nBertha Fuglestad. They are both living in Chicago enjoying excellent\\r\\nhealth at the age of eighty-eight. Björn Björnson settled in Rochester,\\r\\nNew York, where he died in 1854.[242] On their eighty-fifth birthday\\r\\nin 1906, the twin sisters held a family festival at the home of Mrs.\\r\\nEric Ross at which four children and one grandchild of Mrs. Erickson\\r\\nwere present and Mrs. Fuglestad\\'s four children, eighteen grandchildren\\r\\nand fifteen great grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [242] For above facts I am indebted to Mrs. Eric Ross of 217\\r\\n        Mozart Street, Chicago, a daughter of Mrs. Fuglestad.\\r\\n        Mrs. Erickson\\'s children: Mrs. Robert S. Carroll, Otto G.\\r\\n        Erickson, Samuel Erickson and Alex Erickson. Mrs. Fuglestad\\'s\\r\\n        children are: Mrs. Anna Ross, Thomas B. Fuglestad in Chicago,\\r\\n        Peter A. Fuglestad, Forest City, Iowa, and Mrs. Mary Jacobson\\r\\n        in Beltram, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n          _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers in the Township of\\r\\n                Pleasant Spring, Dane County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have above spoken of the fact that Knut H. Roe was one of the party\\r\\nthat emigrated with John Luraas from Tin, Telemarken, in 1839. These\\r\\ntwo men became the first Norwegians to settle in the townships of\\r\\nPleasant Spring and Dunkirk respectively in 1843. Roe had lived for a\\r\\ntime in La Salle County, Illinois, going to Racine County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin 1842, as we have seen above. In the fall of 1841 a few of the\\r\\nsettlers in Racine County had travelled west as far as Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie, for the purpose of inspecting the uninhabited country there,\\r\\nof which they seem already to have heard from friends. In the townships\\r\\nof Albion and Christiana, these met and spoke with those who had come\\r\\nthere from Jefferson Prairie in 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe favorable report of these explorers relative to the fertility\\r\\nof the soil and the general character of the country on Koshkonong\\r\\ncreated considerable restlessness among the pioneers at Wind Lake, in\\r\\nRacine County, and many decided to remove to Dane County. Among these\\r\\nwere Knut Roe and John Luraas. We shall first follow the fortunes of\\r\\nthe former. As soon as the snow was gone with the end of the winter\\r\\nof 1842-43, Roe walked on foot to Koshkonong, where he visited the\\r\\ndifferent parts of the prairie, and selected a spot on which to settle.\\r\\nThen he walked back to Racine County. John Luraas and family also\\r\\nhaving decided to remove to Dane County, the two families secured a\\r\\nteam for the overland journey; they reached their destination on one\\r\\nof the last days in May. \"Two weeks before St. John\\'s eve,\" writes\\r\\nRoe, \"my first home, a hut of brushwood and leaves, supported at the\\r\\nfour corners by an oak, was ready sufficiently so that my wife and\\r\\nchild and myself could find protection therein against rain and wind.\"\\r\\nThis he built in the southeast corner of section twenty-two in the\\r\\nTown of Pleasant Spring, at a point about two miles and a half west\\r\\nof Utica. Knut Roe, his wife, Anne, and family were the first white\\r\\nsettlers in the township. An interview with Roe which the editor of\\r\\n_Billed-Magazin_ prints will therefore be of interest. He says: \"I\\r\\noften received visits by the Indians, and the many deep paths in the\\r\\nground showed that the son of the wilderness often held forth in the\\r\\nregion about me. In their marches between the Lake Koshkonong and the\\r\\nfour lakes which have made Madison famed far and wide for its beauty,\\r\\nthe Redskins often pitched camp close to my brushwood hut. Sometimes\\r\\nI accompanied them on their hunts. They never caused me any trouble,\\r\\nbut on the contrary were always ready to be helpful. There was game in\\r\\nplenty. Almost daily I saw herds of deer, flocks of prairie chickens,\\r\\nand I was often awakened at night by the howling of the wolf.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn Roe built a log cabin; in this cabin he and family\\r\\ncontinued to live till 1870. During the earliest years, he writes,\\r\\nhe was obliged to drive as far as Whitewater, thirty miles east, or\\r\\nMadison, a distance of eighteen miles, for flour. At Lake Mills,\\r\\ntwenty-two miles, there was a saw-mill. After a time the settlers began\\r\\nto sell some wheat; this had to be hauled to Milwaukee, seventy-five\\r\\nmiles away. Their only means of transportation at that time was the\\r\\n_Kubberulle_, or block-wheeled wagon, drawn by oxen, much of the way\\r\\nthrough forest, where a way had to be cut by the axe. Two weeks after\\r\\nRoe\\'s settling, Ole K. Trovatten came from Muskego and located on the\\r\\nfarm later owned by Gunder J. Felland. Trovatten, who had been a school\\r\\nteacher in Norway, had emigrated from Laurdal, Telemarken, to Muskego\\r\\nin 1840. He was, therefore, the second Norwegian to locate in Pleasant\\r\\nSpring. He, however, left for Cottage Grove that same fall. See below,\\r\\npage 252.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next arrivals were Osmund Lunde and his brother-in-law, Aslak\\r\\nKostvedt, both from Vinje in Telemarken. The latter bought land three\\r\\nmiles southeast of West Koshkonong Church, near Trovatten\\'s place.\\r\\nLunde lived at first with Kostvedt; thereupon he bought land in section\\r\\nthree. Some years later Lunde sold his farm to Kittil Rinden, oldest\\r\\nson of Kittil Rinden, Sr., and moved to Minnesota, whither Kostvedt\\r\\nalso moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third of August a small group of immigrants arrived and selected\\r\\na home and settled directly west of West Koshkonong Church, on section\\r\\nfourteen. These were Knut A. Juve,[243] his brother, Knut Gjötil\\r\\n(or Jöitil), and his sister, Tone Lien, then a widow. Juve owned an\\r\\nestate in Telemarken, which he sold upon deciding to emigrate, in May,\\r\\n1843. They sailed on the brig _Washington_, which carried eighty-six\\r\\npassengers, mostly from the parishes of Hvideseid and Laurdal.[244]\\r\\nThey landed in New York on July fourth. It was the intention of the\\r\\nmembers of this party to settle in Illinois, but in Milwaukee they were\\r\\nadvised against doing so; they were told that many who had settled in\\r\\nIllinois had later moved to Wisconsin and bought homes there. Many\\r\\nremained in Milwaukee, some went direct to Koshkonong, while others,\\r\\nincluding the Juve party, went to Wind Lake, in Racine County. Knut\\r\\nJuve was not pleased with Wind Lake. One day he met a pioneer settler\\r\\nfrom the Town of Christiana, Dane County, who, when he noticed Juve\\'s\\r\\ndowncast condition, said to him: \"Go farther west; not until you get\\r\\nto Koshkonong are you in America.\" Juve acted upon the advice; he and\\r\\nhis brother and sister started west soon after, arriving in the Town\\r\\nof Pleasant Spring, as we have said, on the third day of August. Half\\r\\na mile west of where the church was built two years later, they built\\r\\ntheir hut of brushwood, thatched with straw.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [243] Knut Juve was born in 1799. Knut Jöitil in 1803.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [244] Most of them in fair circumstances says Juve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our furniture,\" says Juve,[245] \"consisted of a few chests, that\\r\\nwere used both as table and chairs, while the bed was arranged on the\\r\\nground on some twigs and grass.\" Here they lived till October, when\\r\\nthey made a dugout, in which they lived till the following summer. Both\\r\\nJuve and Jöitil were soon, however, taken ill with the climate fever.\\r\\nIn the interview from which we have already cited, he speaks of how\\r\\nmany a time during his illness he longed back to the old home, kindred\\r\\nand friends in his native land. In the summer of 1844 a log cabin\\r\\nwas built, and not long after Jöitil and the widowed sister also had\\r\\nerected log cabins of their own in his immediate neighborhood. In the\\r\\nspring of 1844 Juve broke two acres of ground and raised a little corn\\r\\nand potatoes; the next summer he raised enough of grain and potatoes\\r\\nfor family use; the third year he was able to sell a little. Such were\\r\\nthe beginnings of agriculture in the wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [245] Interview in _Billed-Magazin_, 1870, page twenty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of August a large number came and located in the\\r\\nsettlement. Among these were Gunleik T. Sundbö (b.1785), with wife\\r\\nand three sons, two of whom were married and had families.[246]\\r\\nOthers who came were: Tostein G. Bringa (b. 1817), with wife and son,\\r\\nHalvor Laurantson Fosseim (b. 1810), and family, his brother, Ole L.\\r\\nFosseim, and Ole K. Dyrland (b. 1819).[247] Sundbö, Bringa, Fosseim\\r\\nand Dyrland all bought land not far from Knut Juve and Knut Jöitil.\\r\\nDuring the next two months the following arrived: Torbjörn G. Vik,\\r\\nwith wife and son Guttorm, and daughter Anna from Siljord, Aslak E.\\r\\nGroven (b. 1812), and family, from Laurdal, Ole E. Næset (b. 1796),\\r\\nand family, and his brother Aadne, from Vinje, and Gunnar T. Mandt,\\r\\nfrom Moe, Telemarken.[248] Groven settled about a mile east of the\\r\\nWest Koshkonong Church near the Christiana Township line; the two\\r\\nNæset brothers also located near there. This group of immigrants came\\r\\nvia Racine County, where they had remained a few weeks resting after\\r\\nthe journey, as the guests of Even Heg. They arrived on Koshkonong\\r\\nPrairie in the latter part of September, having walked from Muskego.\\r\\nGunnar Mandt first came to Pleasant Spring, but as he did not have\\r\\nanything[249] with which to buy land, as he says, he worked for\\r\\nothers there and elsewhere for five years. From his autobiographical\\r\\nsketch[250] I cite the following account of the method of threshing in\\r\\nthose days:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"There were no mowers, no reapers, binders or threshing machines,\\r\\n  everything had to be done by hand. When we were to thrash, the\\r\\n  sheaves of wheat or oats were placed on the ground in a large\\r\\n  circle. Then three or four yoke of oxen were tied together with\\r\\n  an iron chain; one man stood in the center of the circle on the\\r\\n  sheaves of grain and drove the oxen around over the grain. These\\r\\n  would then stamp the kernels out of the straw little by little, and\\r\\n  so we kept on, until we had the sheaves replaced by new ones and\\r\\n  got the straw away. For cleansing the grain thus secured, we used\\r\\n  short basins or bowls such as were made in Norway formerly. After\\r\\n  a while we got a kind of fanning-mill, mower, reaper, etc. But\\r\\n  they were imperfect and cannot be compared with the machines and\\r\\n  implements used nowadays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [246] Torkild Sundbö and wife, Margit, later moved to Sun Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [247] Dyrland says there were 211 immigrants on the ship on which\\r\\n        he came, and most of these, it seems, were from Telemarken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [248] His brother, also named Gunnar, came to America in 1848; T.\\r\\n        G. Mandt, inventor of the Stoughton wagon, was a son of the\\r\\n        latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [249] Endre Vraa paid his passage to America.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [250] Published in _Amerika_ and _Skandinaven_ in January, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunnar Mandt worked in Chicago during the years 1844-45, where he got\\r\\nseventy-five cents a day, but had to furnish his own keep. In 1846\\r\\nhe returned to Pleasant Spring; in April, 1848, he married Synneva\\r\\nOlsdatter Husebö, from Systrond, Sogn, who had come to America with\\r\\nher parents in 1844. Having secured his own farm (on section nine) he\\r\\nfarmed there until 1875, when he moved to the village of Stoughton.\\r\\nGunnar Mandt died in December, 1907, his wife having died a month\\r\\nearlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of nine sections (13-15 and 22-27) in this part of the\\r\\nTownship of Pleasant Spring, was settled before the winter of 1843-44.\\r\\nKnut Roe says that, while he was alone there when he came in June, he\\r\\nhad neighbors on all sides before winter came, although the distance\\r\\nbetween the pioneer cabins was, of course, considerable. The year 1844\\r\\nbrought a large influx of settlers, chiefly from Telemarken, but in\\r\\npart also from Voss. Among them I shall here speak only of Hendrik Hæve\\r\\nand family, from Voss, who located somewhat farther north, on section\\r\\none, on the property later owned and occupied by his oldest son, Ole\\r\\nHæve (Havey); Anfin O. Holtan and family from Sogn, who settled in the\\r\\nsoutheastern part of the town on section thirty-six, where the son,\\r\\nOle Holtan, later lived; and Ole Iverson and his wife Angeline and son\\r\\nLewis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few others, as Aanund O. Drotning, from Vinje, and Knut H.\\r\\nTeisberg, from Laurdal, Telemarken, who came to America in 1843, but\\r\\nthey, too, settled elsewhere first; we shall have occasion to speak\\r\\nof them again. Finally, relative to Knut Roe, I may add that he and\\r\\nhis wife continued to live on the old homestead till their death; he\\r\\ndied as early as 1874, but she lived till 1908, being then a little\\r\\nover ninety years of age. The homestead was owned by the oldest son,\\r\\nHelleik. On the occasion of Mrs. K. Roe\\'s ninetieth birthday, all her\\r\\nchildren, eight grandchildren and twenty-five great-grandchildren,\\r\\ngathered at the old home to commemorate the event.[251]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now turn to Dunkirk Township, the earliest settling of which\\r\\nalso dates from 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [251] Ole K. Roe of Stoughton, is a son of K. Roe; other children\\r\\n        are: Mrs. F. Johnson, Mrs. Ole Thorsen, Mrs. O. Swerig and\\r\\n        Mrs. J. King. Since the above was written I have learned that\\r\\n        Helleik Roe has died (April, 1909).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The First Norwegian Settlers in the Townships of\\r\\n                  Dunkirk, Dunn, and Cottage Grove, in\\r\\n                        Dane County, Wisconsin._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settler in the Town of Dunkirk was John Nelson\\r\\nLuraas. Together with Helge Grimsrud he had explored Dunkirk and\\r\\nsurrounding country in the fall of 1842 and selected a site on which\\r\\nto settle. His father, Nils Johnson Luraas (b. 1789), arrived from\\r\\nNorway in June, 1843, and came with his son direct from Muskego to\\r\\nKoshkonong, where the party arrived on June sixteenth. An American by\\r\\nthe name of John Wheeler had settled in the town two weeks earlier,\\r\\nbeing the only white man there.[252] Luraas settled on section three,\\r\\nabout two miles east of the present city of Stoughton, and three miles\\r\\nsouth of where his companion, Knut Roe, located in the Town of Pleasant\\r\\nSpring. Only about a week after Luraas\\'s arrival, two more families,\\r\\nwho also came from Muskego, arrived and settled there, namely, Helge\\r\\nSivertson Grimsrud, wife Birgitte, son Sigurd, and Hans P. Tverberg and\\r\\nwife Ingeborg, and John P. Tverberg. The former had emigrated from\\r\\nNorway (via Drammen and Gothenburg) the year before, while Tverberg had\\r\\ncome in 1841. They were all from Tin, in Telemarken. Helge Grimsrud\\r\\npossessed considerable means in Norway and owned a fine estate, which\\r\\nhe sold upon emigrating. Grimsrud bought land in section two, directly\\r\\neast of Luraas, while Tverberg settled a mile south of Luraas in\\r\\nsection ten.[253] The next settler was Gaute Ingbrigtson Gulliksrud\\r\\n(b. 1815), from Tin, Telemarken, who arrived there five weeks later,\\r\\nthat is, in August.[254] He came in a party of about one hundred and\\r\\ntwenty persons, mostly from Telemarken, embarking at Skien, and sailed\\r\\nvia Havre de Grace to New York. Most of the party went temporarily to\\r\\nMuskego. Gulliksrud did not like Muskego, and soon after set out for\\r\\nKoshkonong. Having selected a location for his home, he bought, for\\r\\n$200, a hundred and sixty acres of land, near his countrymen, chiefly\\r\\nin section ten, and erected his log cabin a short distance north of\\r\\nHans Tverberg\\'s home.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [252] Herein I accept the authority of _Billed-Magazin_. _The\\r\\n        History of Dane County_, however, says that John Luraas was\\r\\n        the first white settler in the town, Chauncey Isham and John\\r\\n        Wheeler coming soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [253] Helge Grimsrud\\'s wife\\'s parents and a sister had emigrated\\r\\n        in 1841 and located in Muskego. Upon returning to Muskego\\r\\n        from Koshkonong in the fall of 1842, Grimsrud went direct to\\r\\n        Milwaukee and bought 240 acres of land, being the first to\\r\\n        purchase land in Dunkirk. He died in 1856.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [254] Two of his maternal uncles and a brother had emigrated in\\r\\n        1839 and located in Muskego; letters from these induced them\\r\\n        to emigrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were then in the fall of 1843 four Norwegian families settled in\\r\\nthe Town of Dunkirk. In the following year a considerable number of\\r\\nimmigrants came from Norway (Telemarken, Voss, and Sogn) but Dunkirk\\r\\ndid not receive many of those who came that year; they settled mostly\\r\\nin Christiana or Pleasant Spring, while some now began to find homes in\\r\\nCottage Grove and Dunn, immediately north and west of Pleasant Spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settlers in the Town of Dunn were Nils Ellefson\\r\\nMastre and Lars Mastre, who had come to America in 1845; they located\\r\\nin Dunn, just across the Pleasant Spring line soon after arriving;\\r\\nAmerican families had settled in the township before them. Ingebrigt\\r\\nJohnson Helle, from Kragerö, was the next settler there, but he didn\\'t\\r\\nenter Dunn until 1849; he emigrated in 1845 but had worked in Buffalo\\r\\nfour years.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn O. Hougen, from Solör, Norway, was the first Norwegian to settle\\r\\nin Cottage Grove, where he came in the summer of 1842, consequently a\\r\\nyear before Roe and others came to Pleasant Spring. Hougen had been\\r\\na baker in Christiana and usually went by the name of John Baker (or\\r\\nBager). Some years later he removed to Coon Prairie, in Vernon County,\\r\\nWisconsin. Björn Tovsen Vasberg, from Laurdal, Telemarken, also located\\r\\nin Cottage Grove in the summer of 1842. Nothing seems to be known of\\r\\nhis antecedents, and little that is favorable seems to be known of him\\r\\nduring his brief career in the township. He later moved to Minnesota,\\r\\nwhere he lived, it seems, a roving life, being at last found dead on\\r\\nthe public highway. He was a notorious, and as far as I know, the only\\r\\ninstance of the vagabond and ne\\'er-do-well among the Norwegian pioneers\\r\\nof those days. The next Norwegian settler in the Town of Cottage Grove\\r\\nwas Halvor Kostvedt,[255] from Vinje Parish, who emigrated in the\\r\\nspring of 1842; he lived for a year in Christiana Township, and came\\r\\nto Cottage Grove in the summer of 1843 and made a dugout on section\\r\\ntwenty-four, in which he lived the first year. Others who came on the\\r\\nsame ship were Alexander O. Bækhus (or Norman), Ole A. Haatvedt and\\r\\nOsmund Lunde. The first of these located in Christiana, but later moved\\r\\nto Minnesota; Ole Haatvedt settled on Jefferson Prairie, whence some\\r\\nyears later he went to Iowa, while Asmund Lunde, after remaining a year\\r\\nin Muskego, came to Pleasant Spring, as we have seen, in the summer of\\r\\n1843. Ole Trovatten, whom we have already met, both in Muskego and in\\r\\nPleasant Spring, came to Cottage Grove in the fall of 1843. Trovatten\\r\\nis reputed to have been a man of unusual natural gifts and considerable\\r\\neloquence. He served as deacon in West Koshkonong and Liberty Prairie\\r\\nchurches for many years, a capacity in which he had officiated also\\r\\nin Norway. He later affiliated with the East Koshkonong Church, which\\r\\ncongregation he, with O. P. Selseng, represented on the occasion of the\\r\\nfounding of the Norwegian Synod in East Koshkonong Church, on February\\r\\n5th, 1853.[256]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [255] Called also Halvor i Vinje.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [256] Page 15 of _Kort Uddrag of den norske Synodes Historie_, by\\r\\n        Rev. Jacob Aal Ottesen, Decorah, 1893.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsmund Aslakson Næstestu, with wife and family, came to Muskego in\\r\\nthe fall of 1843, where he worked as a blacksmith for six months. He\\r\\nremoved to Koshkonong early the next spring, going direct to Halvor\\r\\nKostvedt, with whom he lived in the dugout the first summer. In 1847 he\\r\\nbought land in the same locality. Næstestu[257] is said to have been\\r\\nfamed in Norway as a mechanical genius of rare talent. On one occasion\\r\\nKing Carl Johan was shown a gun made by the farmer\\'s son in Vinje; the\\r\\nKing afterwards sent Asmund Næstestu a silver cup as a token of his\\r\\npleasure over the excellent workmanship of the gun. Asmund Næstestu\\r\\nbought a farm a mile and a half northwest of Nora Post Office in 1854,\\r\\nwhere he, in the course of time, became the owner of two hundred acres.\\r\\nAmong others who came to America with Asmund Næstestu in 1843 and later\\r\\nsettled in Cottage Grove, were Næstestu\\'s nephews, Aslak and Halvor\\r\\nOlson Bækhus (or Gjergjord as they called themselves in this country),\\r\\nBjörn O. Hustvedt, Halvor Donstad and Knut Teisberg.[258]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [257] Asmund Næstestu was the son of Aslak Næstestu, a man of much\\r\\n        native ability and influence in Vinje. Anna Næstestu, a\\r\\n        daughter of Aslak, married Ole Bækhus; they were the parents\\r\\n        of the Bækhus (Gjergjord) brothers of whom we shall speak in\\r\\n        the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally I shall add the names of Björn A. Stondall and Björn\\r\\nStevens Hustvedt, two of Cottage Grove\\'s well known early pioneers,\\r\\nwho emigrated in 1843 and stopped through the winter in Muskego;\\r\\nthence they came to Koshkonong, locating in Cottage Grove in the\\r\\nspring of 1844.[259] Björn Stondal was from Vinje, in Telemarken,\\r\\nbeing born on the farm Næstestu in Bögrænd in 1823. He sailed on\\r\\nthe ship _Vinterflid_ from Porsgrund in the spring of 1843, as he\\r\\nrelates.[260] They were eleven weeks on the ocean before reaching New\\r\\nYork. The objective point was Milwaukee and the Muskego settlement;\\r\\nhere they stopped during the winter with an American by the name of\\r\\nPutnam,--seven persons in a hut that was fourteen feet long and ten\\r\\nfeet wide. In the spring of 1844 he walked west to Koshkonong, where he\\r\\ndecided to buy eighty acres of land in section thirty-two in southern\\r\\nCottage Grove, and begin the occupation of a farmer. Four years later\\r\\nhe married Gunhild Bergland. Björn Stondal died in April, 1906, at the\\r\\nage of eighty-three, survived by his wife and nine children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [258] They came in the same ship as Knut Jöitil and Anund Drotning,\\r\\n        who, as we have seen, located in Pleasant Spring. Knut\\r\\n        Teisberg moved from Cottage Grove to Pleasant Spring in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [259] Hustvedt wrote his name Ben Stevens.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [260] According to interview printed in _Amerika_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _The Expansion of the Koshkonong Settlement into\\r\\n               Sumner and Oakland Townships in Jefferson\\r\\n             County. Increased Immigration from Telemarken.\\r\\n                       New Settlers from Kragerö,\\r\\n                         Drammen and Numedal._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our discussion of the settling of Koshkonong by immigrants from\\r\\nNumedal in 1840-42, mention was made of Tore Knudson Nore and wife\\r\\nGjertud among those who arrived in 1842. Tore Nore did not, however,\\r\\nlocate in Christiana or Albion townships, where his compatriots had\\r\\nsettled. He selected land about three miles southeast of where Gunnul\\r\\nVindeig had located, across the Jefferson County line in what later was\\r\\nnamed Sumner Township. Tore Nore, who was then a man of about forty\\r\\nyears of age and had a large family, had emigrated in the spring of\\r\\n1842, but had not, as the immigrants from Numedal so far had generally\\r\\ndone, gone to Jefferson Prairie or Rock Prairie, but had stopped in\\r\\nMuskego. Being dissatisfied here, he decided to go to Koshkonong.\\r\\nTaking his family with him, he arrived there about October first\\r\\nof that year. Soon after he erected his log cabin in Sumner,[261]\\r\\nbeing, therefore, the first Norwegian to settle in that part of\\r\\nJefferson County, his being the second family to enter the township\\r\\nof Sumner.[262] Here he lived till his death in 1868, at the age of\\r\\nseventy-six. Gjertrud Nore died in 1884. Three sons are prosperous\\r\\nfarmers living in the neighborhood of the father\\'s original homestead.\\r\\nA daughter, Gro, married Peder Larsen Svartskuren (or Svartskor) in\\r\\nNorway, in June, 1842. They became the second Norwegian family to\\r\\nsettle in the township. Peder Svartskuren was a native of Konigsberg,\\r\\nNorway, being, as it appears, the third emigrant to America from that\\r\\nlocality.[263]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [261] This log-cabin was still standing not many years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [262] An American family had come there before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [263] The first emigrants from Kongsberg were Thomas Braaten, and\\r\\n        Halvor Funkelien.\\r\\nIn an interview with Svein Nilson printed in 1870, Peder Svartskuren\\r\\nmentions Björn Anderson (Kvelve), Amund Hornefjeld, Gunnul Vindeig and\\r\\nThorsten Olson as being the only Norwegians living in the neighboring\\r\\ntowns of Albion and Christiana when he came there. He speaks of Sumner\\r\\nTownship as being a heavy primeval forest, with only here and there a\\r\\nstretch of open country. \"There was an abundance of game, deers and\\r\\nprairie chickens, and the lake (Koshkonong) and creek were full of\\r\\nfish. The Indians were roving about the country, but they did no one\\r\\nany harm and were kindly and ever ready to help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Svartskuren, who is now eighty-seven years old and quite feeble,\\r\\nhas, since 1902, lived at Leeds, North Dakota, with a son, Carl,\\r\\nhe having sold the homestead after the father\\'s death, and moved to\\r\\nViroqua, Wisconsin, and later to Leeds. Peder Svartskuren was among\\r\\nthe founders of the East Koshkonong Church; he was a man of strong\\r\\ncharacter, who enjoyed in large degree the love and the respect of his\\r\\nfellows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Sumner did not receive many accessions from Norway. In\\r\\nthe same interview Svartskuren says: \"There are now twelve Norwegian\\r\\nfamilies, besides six Swedish families. The rest are German and\\r\\nEnglish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Oakland, Jefferson County, also received a few settlers at\\r\\nthis early period. The earliest arrival there was, I believe, Tollef\\r\\nBækhus and wife, Aasild; they came to Koshkonong in 1843 and located\\r\\ntwo miles east of the village of Rockdale. They were from Laurdal\\r\\nParish, in Upper Telemarken, had been married in 1838, and had two\\r\\nchildren when they came to this country. Tollef Bækhus died in 1897,\\r\\nthe widow lived until 1906, being ninety years old at the time of her\\r\\ndeath. A son, John Bækhus, now owns the homestead.[264]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [264] They had twelve children in all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XVIII above we gave an account of the founding of the\\r\\nKoshkonong Settlement, which began in the townships of Christiana,\\r\\nDeerfield and Albion, in 1840-41. We spoke briefly of the founders and\\r\\nof those who came and joined the three groups of pathfinders in the\\r\\nfollowing year. In Chapter XXVIII a similar record has been given of\\r\\nthe events which led to the settling of the Town of Pleasant Spring by\\r\\nfour families in 1843, and by others in the following year. We have\\r\\nalso observed how the towns of Dunkirk and Cottage Grove became settled\\r\\nin 1843, and that Dunn received its first Norwegian settlers in 1844.\\r\\nThe towns of Sumner and Oakland, in Jefferson County, in the eastern\\r\\nextremity of Koshkonong Prairie also received a small contingent\\r\\nof Norwegian immigrant settlers in 1842 and 1843 respectively. The\\r\\noriginal nucleus and the subsequent expansions of the settlement, east,\\r\\nwest and north, are thereby indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn four years after its inception, the settlement covered an area\\r\\nof about fifteen square miles. But the settlers lived, for the most\\r\\npart, far apart; geographically they had made ample provisions for a\\r\\ngreat settlement in this garden spot of Wisconsin. While there were\\r\\nas yet (in 1843) not more than a hundred and fifty individuals in the\\r\\nsettlement, there was room for thousands more without going beyond\\r\\nthe boundary as already laid out. The beginning made in a few years\\r\\nwas remarkable, but the growth in the years immediately following was\\r\\neven more wonderful. For a time Koshkonong was the destination of\\r\\nfour-fifths of those who emigrated from Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1842 records the beginning of the great development, which\\r\\nin five years resulted in the settling of almost the whole of this\\r\\nvast area by immigrants from Norway. The next year was that of the\\r\\ngreat influx from various points in Telemarken, especially, Siljord,\\r\\nLaurdal and Hvideseid, although there were considerable numbers also\\r\\nfrom Vinje and Tin. The year 1843 was the one in which the Telemarkings\\r\\ntook possession of Koshkonong; they gradually selected their permanent\\r\\nhomes in Pleasant Spring, extending into Dunkirk and Cottage Grove and\\r\\nthe northeastern sections of Christiana (as Eggleson, Bjoin, Hauge,\\r\\nBorgerud, Bosbön and Kingland). The Numedalians came only in limited\\r\\nnumbers after 1842 and did not spread much beyond the original center\\r\\naround East Koshkonong church in southeastern Christiana and northern\\r\\nAlbion townships. Those on the extreme west were Levi Kittilson, Levi\\r\\nHoltan, O. O. Lenaas and Tore E. Smithback, all coming somewhat later\\r\\nthan those in the eastern extremity. The immigration from Numedal,\\r\\nwhich began in Rollaug, is after 1842 almost confined to Flesberg, a\\r\\nparish which furnished no immigrants before 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1843, there came to Koshkonong, 35 families and many single\\r\\npersons, or a total of 182 individuals. This was the year of heaviest\\r\\nimmigration to Koshkonong. The year\\'s influx is significant in the\\r\\nlarge number of districts in Norway represented, Telemarken leading\\r\\nas has been pointed out above. In addition to 9 persons from Numedal,\\r\\nand a small contingent from Voss, the first party of fourteen persons\\r\\narrived from Kragerö. These first immigrants from Kragerö were: Bjorn\\r\\nO. Rom, Kjöstolf Tollefsen Hulderöen[265] (b. 1821), Even E. Buaas (b.\\r\\n1799), Abraham K. Rönningen, Erick K. Rönningen, Halvor E. Dahl (b.\\r\\n1802), wife Anne, and family, Torbjörn K. Rönningen, Glus P. Tyvang and\\r\\nwife, Audi, and Peder K. Rönningen. From Leikanger in Sogn[266] Anna L.\\r\\nEggum (or Eggene, b. 1811), who in 1845 married Sjur C. Droksvold, from\\r\\nVoss; from Lier came Knut O. Lier, as also the widow Anne Thorstad,\\r\\nKnut Asdöhldalen and Gabriel Björnson (from Drammen); from Drangedal\\r\\ncame Baruld J. Strandskougen and family, from Sandsværd, Ellef A. Berg,\\r\\nfrom Skauger, Halvor J. Stubberud, from Rögen, Lars P. Haukelien and\\r\\nfamily, from Holte, Tarald E. Midböe, from Gjerpen, Peder H. Moe, and\\r\\nfrom Hallingdal, Even Olson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [265] Came to Muskego in 1843, went back to Norway and returned,\\r\\n        settling in Koshkonong in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [266] There was one immigrant from Aurland, Sogn, in 1843, but he\\r\\n        stopped the first winter in Muskego. See next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have noted the fact above that there came for the first time in\\r\\n1843 a group of immigrants from Flesberg Parish in Numedal. We shall\\r\\nnote here briefly who these were. For the facts I am indebted to Mrs.\\r\\nLevi Holtan, formerly of Utica, at present of Stoughton, Wisconsin.\\r\\nThe name of the ship on which these people came, Mrs. Holtan cannot\\r\\nremember, but it was commanded by Captain Overvind; the first mate\\r\\nwas Friis. In the party of ninety persons were: Halvor Kjölen, Juul\\r\\nHamre and wife Anne, Tostein Ullebær and Halvor Aasen, who went to\\r\\nJefferson Prairie,[267] Gulleik Laugen, who stopped in Rochester, but\\r\\nsoon after came west, locating on Rock Prairie, Paal (\"Spelleman\")\\r\\nLund, Guldbrand G. Holtan, a widower, his brother Ole G. Holtan,[268]\\r\\nKnut K. Bakli and Kittil G. Bakli and families, Ambjör Olsdatter and\\r\\nSynnöve Kristoffersdatter Bekkjorden from Lyngdal Annex of Flesberg.\\r\\nThis was the ship on which also Per Svartskuren and wife Gro, Knut\\r\\nLier and Baruld Johnson came on.[269] In the same party emigrated also\\r\\nKlemet Larson Stalsbraaten and wife Gunild, and his brother Halvor\\r\\nStalsbraaten (Kravik) from Sigdal in Numedal. Halvor Stalsbraaten took\\r\\nthe name Kravik from the estate where he had worked five years before\\r\\nemigrating. Reverend Kasberg writes me, citing Halvor Kravik, that they\\r\\n(the Stalsbraatens)\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Bought tickets for America at Konigsberg Fair, left Drammen May\\r\\n  6 ult., 1843, arrived at New York July fourth, ninety passengers\\r\\n  on the ship.\" ... \"The company of immigrants went from Milwaukee\\r\\n  to Muskego. Halvor Kravik and a young boy from Sandsværd walked to\\r\\n  Koshkonong, arriving Friday evening. Monday morning Halvor was at\\r\\n  work for one of the Englishmen further south. Kravik took a claim\\r\\n  in 1844. During the winter he staid with Gunnul Vindeg, sleeping\\r\\n  in the part of the house occupied at the time by Rev. Dietrichson,\\r\\n  while the parsonage was being built.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [267] Rev. K. A. Kasberg, of Spring Grove, Minn., writes me that\\r\\n        Halvor Kravik in speaking of some of these people says Halvor\\r\\n        Aasen went to Rock Run as did also Paal \"Spellemand.\" He also\\r\\n        adds the name Gunnar Springen who, he says, went to Rock\\r\\n        Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [268] As I learn through Rev. G. A. Larsen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [269] The name of the ship, as we learn elsewhere, was _Hercules_.\\r\\n        See above page 228.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the party also came to Koshkonong a short while after,\\r\\nexcept those who went to Rock County. Ole G. Holtan (b. 1821) and\\r\\nAmbjör Olsdatter (b. 1821) were married a few weeks after arriving;\\r\\nOle Holtan died in 1851, leaving wife and two children, Anna and Ole.\\r\\nAnna later became the wife of Levor Kittilsen Fjöse (Levi Kittilsen)\\r\\nwell known farmer and prominent in the councils of the West Koshkonong\\r\\nChurch.[270] Ambjör, widow of Ole G. Holtan, married Nils Torgerson\\r\\nGrötrud in 1852; he had come to America in 1849.[271]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [270] Levi Kittilsen died suddenly in 1907; the widow is living (at\\r\\n        Stoughton); a daughter, Andrea, is married to Rev. Abel Lien,\\r\\n        Ada, Minn.; a son, Carl, is in Nome, Alaska. Dr. Albert N.\\r\\n        Kittilsen, another son, owns valuable mines at Nome, Alaska;\\r\\n        he is living in the State of Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [271] Nils Grötrud assumed the farm name Holtan and is therefore\\r\\n        Nils T. Holtan. He located first on the Holtan farm south of\\r\\n        Utica. About 1868 the family settled two miles east of Utica.\\r\\nWe have, on page 183 above, spoken of Lars J. Holo, who was the\\r\\nearliest immigrant from Ringsaker (1839). From Rochester, New York,\\r\\nhe came to Muskego, Racine County, Wisconsin, in 1841; in 1843 he\\r\\nlocated permanently on Koshkonong. His son Johannes also settled on\\r\\nKoshkonong, as also the sons Lars and Martin Holo. The latter now owns\\r\\nthe farm originally purchased in Albion Township by Björn Kvelve.\\r\\nHalvor Kravik (b. 1820) was the son of Lars A. Stalsbraaten and wife\\r\\nMaria. In 1845 he married Kristi Guldbrandson, who had come to America\\r\\nin 1842. They bought land and settled permanently about three-quarters\\r\\nof a mile south of East Koshkonong Church at what came to be called\\r\\n_Kravikhaugen_ (the Kravik hill). The homestead has now for many years\\r\\nbeen occupied by the oldest son, Lars C. Kravik. Since about 1899,\\r\\nHalvor and his wife lived with their son-in-law, Rev. K. A. Kasberg,\\r\\nin Stoughton, Wisconsin, later in Grand Forks, North Dakota, now for\\r\\nseveral years past at Spring Grove, Houston County, Minnesota. Mrs.\\r\\nKravik died a year ago; Mr. Kravik in February, 1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nKjöstolf Hulderöen (Hulröya), who came to Muskego in 1843, went back to\\r\\nNorway two years later, but returned to America in 1846, settling on\\r\\nKoshkonong, at Cambridge. In 1848 he married Hæge O. Sube, who had come\\r\\nfrom Telemarken to this country that year. In 1853 he started a general\\r\\nmerchandise business in Rockdale, Dane County, where he lived till\\r\\nhis death in 1889. The widow is living with her oldest daughter Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Halvorson in Rockdale. A son, Charlie C. Tellefson, one of Dane\\r\\nCounty\\'s prominent democrats, resides at Utica, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGabriel Björnson was one of the few who came to Koshkonong from the\\r\\nregion of Drammen. He married Gunhild Grötrud, sister of Nils T. Holtan\\r\\n(Grötrud). Björnson is said to have been the first Norwegian to be\\r\\nadmitted to the bar in this country. He died in Ada, Minnesota, in\\r\\n1889; he was at that time County Attorney of Norman County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two families from Voss, who had immigrated earlier among\\r\\nthose who settled permanently on Koshkonong in 1843, namely Styrk\\r\\nOlson Saue, who, we have seen, came to America in 1837, and Gulleik\\r\\nTorsteinson Saue, who immigrated in 1840; they had lived most of\\r\\nthe time in Chicago. There Styrk Saue married Eli K. Væte; she\\r\\ndied at Deerfield about 1885. Styrk died in 1894. Gulleik Saue (b.\\r\\n1821) married Donant Rölje in 1844. They purchased land in northern\\r\\nChristiania, not far from Cambridge; here, and in neighboring parts of\\r\\nDeerfield Township, Gulleik Thompson, as he called himself, became in\\r\\nthe course of time the owner of about 1,000 acres of farm land. At the\\r\\ntime of his death he was Koshkonong\\'s wealthiest farmer. His son, Hon.\\r\\nT. G. Thompson, occupies the old home and owns the estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Coming of the First Large Party of Immigrants\\r\\n                 from Sogn. New Accessions from Voss._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been noted above that one of the earliest pioneers at Wiota,\\r\\nLa Fayette County, Wisconsin, was from Vik Parish in Sogn, namely,\\r\\nPer Unde who emigrated in 1839. In 1842 Ole Unde came and joined his\\r\\nbrother at Wiota. In 1843 Ole Schærdalen[272] came to America from\\r\\nAurland, Sogn; he was the first emigrant from that parish. It has been\\r\\nsaid that there was a party of immigrants from Sogn in 1843, but this\\r\\nI doubt as I have been able nowhere to verify it. Ole Schærdalen went\\r\\nto Muskego where he stopped the first year, then he joined the party\\r\\nof Sognings who came that year and passed through Muskego en route\\r\\nfor Koshkonong. Per and Ole Unde wrote letters home to Vik Parish, in\\r\\nresponse to these letters, full of praise for Wisconsin, there came\\r\\nmany immigrants from Vik during the next two years. Ole Schærdalen in a\\r\\nsimilar way aided in promoting emigration from Inner Sogn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [272] So written, but pronounced Schirdalen in the dialect. My\\r\\n        father is the authority for the statement that Schærdalen was\\r\\n        the first to emigrate from Aurland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Aurland Parish lived Ole Torjussen Flom; he had travelled much in\\r\\nNorway and come in contact with people who had relatives and friends\\r\\nin America, and who themselves were planning to emigrate. He was well\\r\\nacquainted with Schærdalen and he had been in Vik and knew, it seems,\\r\\nthe Unde family. Ole T. Flom (b. 1794) was the son of Torjus Flom (b.\\r\\nabout 1765) generally called Torjus i Midgarden, who was the owner of a\\r\\nvaluable estate at Flaam near Fretheim. There were three sons, Gulleik,\\r\\nOle, and Knut; by the right of primogeniture the estate would fall to\\r\\nthe oldest son, Gulleik Flom. Ole Flom had selected for purchase a\\r\\nplace then for sale, in Voss, and it was his intention to remove to\\r\\nVoss. He was, however, prevailed upon not to do this by his father who\\r\\ntold him he would give him half of the family estate. When, however,\\r\\nthe time came, the temptation to follow the general practice and give\\r\\nthe estate intact over to the oldest son became too strong for the\\r\\nfather and he gave it all to Gulleik Flom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle T. Flom then began thinking about emigrating to America. In 1843 he\\r\\nwent to Vik Parish and while there he and Anfin J. Seim agreed to go to\\r\\nAmerica. After he returned to Aurland others in the parish also began\\r\\nto make preparations for leaving for the New World and the fever spread\\r\\nto Fresvik and Systrond and up as far as Sogndal Parish. In the spring\\r\\nof 1844 a considerable number from these regions and from Vik stood\\r\\nready to emigrate. Ole T. Flom, wife Anna and sons Ole and Anders,\\r\\nIvar H. Vangen and Knut Aaretuen (i Aureto), wife Anna[273] and three\\r\\nchildren left Aurlandsvangen on the 12th of April. They had engaged\\r\\npassage on _Juno_, Captain Bendixen, but were obliged to wait in Bergen\\r\\ntwo weeks before sailing. In the meantime others who also were to go on\\r\\n_Juno_ joined them at Bergen. Among them were the Melaas families from\\r\\nNorum Annex of Sogndal Parish; they were the first to emigrate from\\r\\nthat district. This party was composed of the following eleven members:\\r\\nMons Lasseson Melaas (b. 1787) and wife Martha; Kristen L. Melaas,\\r\\nwife Aase and daughter Anna; Johans K. Bjelde and wife Kristi; Ole A.\\r\\nSlinde, wife Martha;[274] and two children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [273] She was a daughter of Ole Schærdalen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [274] A daughter of Mons Melaas. Their husbands took the name\\r\\n        Melaas in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following persons from various parts of Sogn also embarked on\\r\\n_Juno_: Anders Engen, Per L. Gjerde, Michel J. Engesæter and wife\\r\\nSynnöve from Systrand, Ole I. Husebö with wife Ingeleiv and children,\\r\\nand Ole A. Værken (Grinde) from Leikanger, Nils T. Seim, wife Mari and\\r\\nchildren (3) and Thomas T. Seim from Lærdal, and the aforementioned\\r\\nAnfin I. Seim from Vik with his wife Britha and five children.[275]\\r\\nThere were about sixty persons on _Juno_ when it sailed in May. At\\r\\nthe same time two other ships sailed from Bergen with immigrants\\r\\nfor America; they were _Kong Sverre_, Captain Vingaard and _Albion_,\\r\\nCaptain Brock. A very large number of those who embarked on these ships\\r\\nalso were from Sogn, especially Vik, nearly all these going to Long\\r\\nPrairie (see next chapter). Among those who came to Koshkonong were:\\r\\nTorstein Thronson Selseng and wife Kari, Knut Gjerde, Ole Selseng,\\r\\nJakob I. Gjerdene, from Sogndal, Elling O. Flatland, wife and children,\\r\\nand Sjur S. Ölman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [275] Relative to the personnel of this party and the sailing\\r\\n        of _Juno_ I am especially to Kristi Melaas, with whom I\\r\\n        have had several interviews on the question. She is the\\r\\n        oldest surviving member of the party and is still living\\r\\n        at Stoughton, Wisconsin. My father, Ole O. Flom, has also\\r\\n        supplied many facts; he was thirteen years old at the time of\\r\\n        immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ sailed three days before _Juno_, but arrived\\r\\nin New York several weeks later. _Juno_ made the journey to New York\\r\\nin five weeks and three days, which, says Kristi Melaas, broke the\\r\\nrecord for fast sailing at that time. \"The Brock ship\" took eight\\r\\nweeks for the journey, while _Kong Sverre_ was on the ocean twelve\\r\\nweeks. The party that came with _Juno_ was therefore the first large\\r\\ngroup of Sognings to land in America, the date of their landing being\\r\\nSt. John\\'s Eve. From New York they went by canal-boat to Buffalo,\\r\\nwhere they arrived on the fourth of July. Here they were put on board\\r\\nan old steamboat, which the immigrants feared would go to the bottom\\r\\nat any moment of the journey, says Mrs. Melaas, over the lakes to\\r\\nMilwaukee, where they arrived at the end of July.[276] Kristi Melaas\\r\\nsays the agent weighed their goods at every stopping place and charged\\r\\ntoll each time. There was no interpreter on the boat who could voice\\r\\ntheir objections. The ticket from New York to Chicago was $14, but by\\r\\nadditional charges along the route, the expense of the inland journey\\r\\nwas greater than that from Bergen to New York. In Milwaukee most of the\\r\\nparty, including Ole Vendelbo, Ole T. Flom, Knut Aaretuen and Michel\\r\\nEngesæter went to Koshkonong via Muskego, but the Melaas family went\\r\\nto Chicago, as did Ole Husebö and one man from Vik who had intended to\\r\\ngo south to Missouri,[277] and they were all met in Chicago by one who\\r\\nwas to bring them to Missouri. It seems, however, that the departure\\r\\nhither was delayed for weeks by their guide who was addicted to drink.\\r\\nIn the meantime the Melaas families becoming discouraged and having\\r\\nmet a certain Ole Bringa who urged them to come to Koshkonong, decided\\r\\nto go where the rest of the party had already directed their course.\\r\\nThey then bought two yoke of oxen and drove to Koshkonong, stopping in\\r\\nPleasant Spring Township about two miles northeast of Lake Kegonsa.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [276] Kristi Melaas called the boat \"_ein rota baot skikke-leg_.\"\\r\\n        She says the agent who had charge of the journey to Milwaukee\\r\\n        was a man by the name of Hohlfelt, a typical immigrant\\r\\n        \"runner,\" it seems, whom she styles as \"ain rigele bedragar,\\r\\n        ain stakkars Mann va han.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [277] This man we learn was Anfin Seim (see next chapter).\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after arriving at Koshkonong they were met by Ole Trovatten\\r\\nwho aided them in the selection of land and who accompanied Johans\\r\\nand Ole Melaas to Milwaukee to purchase the land selected. The two\\r\\nbrothers bought each forty acres at first in section three; later\\r\\nJohans bought out Ole and eighty acres more adjacent to the acquired\\r\\nforty. Ole A. Melaas thereupon located on section thirty-five in\\r\\nCottage Grove Township, a mile northeast of his brother\\'s property.\\r\\nThe Melaas families all located in that immediate neighborhood. Ole\\r\\nT. Flom bought eighty acres in Cottage Grove Township, a mile north\\r\\nof Door Creek where also Ole Vendelbo Olson settled, purchasing forty\\r\\nacres. Olson, however, sold this out to Ole T. Flom not long after,\\r\\nand moved to Minnesota. Nile Seim also located near there, while Per\\r\\nGjerde settled in section two in Pleasant Spring, near the Cottage\\r\\nGrove line. Ole I. Husebö settled in Christiana Township and Sjur Ölman\\r\\nsettled a mile north of Nora Post-office. Ivar Vangen located on Bonnet\\r\\nPrairie, Michel Engesæter lived a few years on Koshkonong, then removed\\r\\nto Norway Grove. Knut Aaretuen settled in Koshkonong, but went west\\r\\n(to Minnesota) after some years. Anfin Seim, who was from Vik, went\\r\\nwith the Melaas families to Chicago, and thence to Long Prairie, Boone\\r\\nCounty, Illinois (see next chapter). The only family from Vik to locate\\r\\nin Koshkonong that year was that of Mons Halringa, who settled in\\r\\nPleasant Spring, a mile or so southwest of Utica; the homestead being\\r\\nthat later occupied by his son Simon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigration to Koshkonong in 1844 was thus principally from Sogn,\\r\\nand it is to be noted that a considerable number of these settled in\\r\\nthe northern extremity of the settlement, north of Door Creek and\\r\\nNora. At the same time there were new accessions from other districts,\\r\\nespecially Voss and Laurdal in Telemarken, while from Rollaug came\\r\\nthat year Gisle H. Venaas and Anfin A. Haugerud. Among those who came\\r\\nfrom Voss I shall name here the brothers Nils and Sjur Droksvold, Ole\\r\\nDroksvold, Henrik O. Hæve, Erik V. Rio (Williams), Erik S. Fliseram,\\r\\nand Knut E. Rokne; all these had families.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong earlier immigrants from Voss who located in Dane County in 1844\\r\\nwere Ole and Steffen Gilderhus; the former had immigrated in 1839 while\\r\\nSteffen came in 1838. As has been observed above, Lars D. Rekve, who\\r\\ncame to America in 1839, did not actually settle in Koshkonong until\\r\\n1844. Rokne and Venaas settled in Christiana, the former three miles\\r\\nwest of Cambridge, the latter two miles northwest of Rockdale. Most of\\r\\nthe Vossings, however, located in Deerfield Township, south and west of\\r\\nthe village of Deerfield. We shall now turn to the immigrants who came\\r\\nfrom Sogn with _Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ in 1844 and did not settle in\\r\\nWisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Long Prairie in Boone County, Illinois; a Sogning\\r\\n                              Settlement._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vicinity of the present village of Capron, Illinois, a few\\r\\nNorwegians located in 1843, forming the nucleus of what later came to\\r\\nbe known as Long Prairie. This settlement is located only a few miles\\r\\nsouth of Jefferson Prairie (which extends into Illinois) and is about\\r\\nsixty-five miles distant west from Chicago. The earliest Norwegian\\r\\nsettlers here were Thor Olson Kaasa and Thov Knutson Traim, his wife\\r\\nIngebjorg and sons, Knut, Kjetil, and Ole, from Siljord in Upper\\r\\nTelemarken. Thor Kaasa was the son of Ole Kaasa and wife Margit, who\\r\\nimmigrated in 1843 with a family of nine children, of whom Thor was the\\r\\noldest. We have spoken of their coming on page 235. Among the other\\r\\nchildren the sons, Gjermund, Jens, Jörgen, and Kittel, and daughters,\\r\\nGuro, Aase, Emelie and Kristense, also moved to the settlement in 1845.\\r\\nBoth Ole Kaasa and his wife died of cholera in 1854; Jörgen Kaasa\\r\\nsettled in Winneshiek County in 1852, while Thor Kaasa moved to Filmore\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota; Jens located permanently in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844 there came five persons from Siljord, Norway, namely Björn\\r\\nBrekketo[278] and wife Guro, her brothers Jens and Steinar, and\\r\\nJohannes Kleiva. Björn Brekketo died early and the widow married Ole\\r\\nOreflaat. Not many more immigrants from Telemarken located at Capron.\\r\\nIn 1844-45 natives of Sogn took possession of Long Prairie, and the\\r\\nsettlement has ever since remained preëminently a Sogning settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [278] Knut Brekketo, a son of Björn Brekketo, is living at Capron\\r\\n        at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have observed above that of those who came from Sogn on the ship\\r\\n_Juno_ in 1844, Anfin Seim and family did not locate in Koshkonong, but\\r\\nwent to Boone County, Illinois; they were the only ones of _Juno\\'s_\\r\\npassengers to settle in Illinois. On the other hand a considerable\\r\\nnumber of those who came on _Kong Sverre_ and _Albion_ located at Long\\r\\nPrairie. Among them were the following who came with the _Albion_:\\r\\nOle J. Aavri, wife Britha and daughter Inga and sons Johans and\\r\\nAndres.[279] Ivar S. Rislauv and wife Eli, a daughter of Ole Aavri;\\r\\nLars Johnson Haave, wife Randi, daughter Britha, and two sons Joe\\r\\n(John) and Ole; Andrew Olson Stadhem (Staim), wife Sigrid, two sons and\\r\\nfour daughters, Olina, Britha, Aase, and Inga; Ole Stadhem and family;\\r\\nIvar I. Haave, wife Barbro and sons Ingebrigt and Elling; Endre H.\\r\\nNumedal and wife Helga, daughter of Ivar Haave; Ole Berdahl and family;\\r\\nIngebrigt N. Vange, wife Britha, and three daughters, and Ole Vange.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [279] Andres Aavri soon after returned to Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the _Sverre_ came: Anders H. Numedal and wife Aagot, Ole Tistele,\\r\\nOle O. Tenold and wife Sigri, Ole P. Tenold, Ole J. Orvedal, wife\\r\\nRagnilda, and three daughters,[280] Lars O. Fölie, Joe Fölie, who died\\r\\nof cholera in Chicago, Ivar Fölie, Lars Jensen Haave, with family and\\r\\nIngebrigt J. Fuglegjærdet. Besides these there were on both ships a\\r\\nnumber of young unmarried men and women whose passage was paid for by\\r\\nLars Johnson Haave and Joe Fölie, who may perhaps be regarded as the\\r\\nleaders of this party. Most of those named were men of means, and some\\r\\nof them were owners of valuable estates which were of course sold and\\r\\nconverted into cash upon emigrating to America. _Albion_ took eight\\r\\nweeks for the voyage. _Kong Sverre_ took twelve. The former arrived in\\r\\nNew York about July 25th.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [280] One of whom married Ole Tenold; they moved to Calmar, Iowa.\\r\\n        The Orvedal family all moved to Winneshiek County in the\\r\\n        fifties.\\r\\nFrom New York they took the usual inland route to Chicago, their\\r\\ndestination being Wiota. But at Belvidere in Boone County, they met\\r\\nThor Olson Kaasa, who advised them strongly against going to Wiota,\\r\\nwhich, he said, was two hundred miles from a market. La Fayette County\\r\\nwas moreover nothing but hills, and he gave such an unfavorable\\r\\ndescription of that locality, that the immigrants decided to accept\\r\\nhis suggestion and go to Long Prairie, where they were told there was\\r\\nplenty of level and fertile land only seventy miles from Chicago. A few\\r\\nwere deputed to wait at Belvidere for those who were coming on _Kong\\r\\nSverre_, and inform them of the change in plans, the rest accompanied\\r\\nKaasa to Boone County,[281] where also soon after the second party\\r\\ncame. Thus by the autumn of 1844 the settlement numbered about one\\r\\nhundred individuals.[282]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [281] Anfin Seim, who had come on _Juno_, was in Chicago when they\\r\\n        came there; he joined them there when they started for Wiota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [282] Some of them moved away a few years later as had already been\\r\\n        indicated in the notes on the preceding pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1845 about fifty persons settled near Capron. It has\\r\\nalready been observed that the Kaasa family moved out there that\\r\\nyear from Chicago.[283] Others came directly from Sogn, Norway, the\\r\\nrecruiting region being Vik Parish exclusively. In that year three\\r\\nships left Bergen again with immigrants principally from Sogn,\\r\\nespecially Aurland and Vik. Those who came from Aurland went to\\r\\nKoshkonong, as also many of those who came from Vik. One of these ships\\r\\nwas _Albion_, Captain Brock, the passengers of which went, most of\\r\\nthem, to Long Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [283] The family numbered ten persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative to the voyage of _Albion_, Elim Ellingson of Capron, who\\r\\nwas on this ship, tells me the following incident which occurred in\\r\\nmid-ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"One day a boat carrying seven or eight men, rather ugly in\\r\\n  appearance, evidently Spanish pirates, approached us from the west,\\r\\n  and their leader demanded to speak with the captain. They said\\r\\n  they came from the New Foundland coast and wanted to send some\\r\\n  letters back. Thereupon they veered about and rowed back to their\\r\\n  ship which lay some distance to the west, put out nine boats with\\r\\n  a large number of men and rowed back toward our ship. The captain,\\r\\n  suspecting their purpose and realizing that we would be helpless\\r\\n  before an attack of pirates, turned the ship around and sailed\\r\\n  back for one whole day and night. In the meantime a considerable\\r\\n  tumult arose on board, axes and guns being gotten in readiness and\\r\\n  many carried up stones from the ballast. We succeeded, however, in\\r\\n  escaping, and, after sailing a day and a night, we turned back and\\r\\n  arrived safely in New York. Here we learned that recently a ship\\r\\n  had arrived at port, the masts of which had been entirely destroyed\\r\\n  by guns from a pirate attack.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ellingson in telling this, added that it is doubtful what fate\\r\\nmight have awaited them, had not the captain promptly turned the ship\\r\\nabout and succeeded in escaping what most certainly would have been a\\r\\nsimilar attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who came on that ship at the same time, and who located\\r\\nat Capron, were: Johans Dahle from Voss, his wife, Ingebjör, and son,\\r\\nOle;[284] Lasse Ellingson Aase (b. 1808), wife Gjöri Ravsdal and five\\r\\nchildren, Ragnild,[285] Elling (Elim), (b. 1835), Nils, Endre and\\r\\nBritha; Andres E. Aase, wife and two sons;[286] Anders O. Torvold,\\r\\nJohannes Lie (now living in Goodhue County, Minnesota), and Johanna\\r\\nStadhem. John Benson of Capron tells me that his grandmother, Martha\\r\\nNumedal, a widow, came there in 1845 or 1846, and also the following:\\r\\nJoe Sande, who was married to a Miss Aase, Edlend Myrkeskog, wife Eli\\r\\nand daughter Ingebjör,[287] and Ole Myrkeskog, who is living at Capron\\r\\nyet at the age of eighty.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [284] A son Andres Dahle was not in the ship, says Elim Ellingson,\\r\\n        and probably did not come therefore until the next year.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [285] Who married Sjur Ölman, who also came in 1844 and settled in\\r\\n        Cottage Grove Township, Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [286] Andres Aase and family soon after moved to Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, and settled near Cambridge; they finally located\\r\\n        permanently in Winneshiek County, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [287] Edlend Myrkeskog died about 1850, and the widow later moved\\r\\n        to Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Prairie Settlement continued to grow for a decade. Space does\\r\\nnot, however, permit printing here the complete list of later arrivals,\\r\\nkindly supplied me by Elim Ellingson and John Benson.[288] We shall now\\r\\nspeak briefly of the growth of the old settlement of Muskego.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [288] Mr. Benson came there in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n         _The Growth of the Racine County (Muskego) Settlement,\\r\\n                      1843-1847. Personal Notes._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter XV we discussed briefly immigration to Racine County in\\r\\n1841-1842. The period of largest growth of the settlement was between\\r\\n1842 and 1847; an especially large party came in 1843. After 1847\\r\\nthe arrivals that became permanent residents were few and scattered.\\r\\nIn the early fall of 1842 there arrived at one time a party of forty\\r\\npersons. They had embarked at Langesund about May 30th, were over\\r\\neleven weeks on the ocean, arriving in New York August 16th. Here\\r\\nthey met Elling Eielson, who accompanied them to Albany; three weeks\\r\\nlater they landed in Milwaukee. Among others there were the following\\r\\npersons: Hermo Nilsen Tufte and family from Aal in Hallingdal, Johan\\r\\nLandsverk and family from Tuddal, Telemarken, Sondre N. Maaren and wife\\r\\nand his brothers Östein and Nils from Tin, Östen G. Meland also from\\r\\nTin, Tostein E. Cleven and Aanund Bjaan (Bjoin) and family who were\\r\\nthe first to emigrate from Siljord. Of these several remained only\\r\\ntemporarily; thus Anders Dahlen went to Winnebago County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nabout 1848, in company with Ole Myhre, an immigrant of the year 1843.\\r\\nKjittel Busness, who was a brother to the said Ole Myhre\\'s wife, also\\r\\nremained in Racine County only a few years, then he went to Stoughton,\\r\\nDane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nSondre Maaren settled on section 34, Town of Norway, where he and his\\r\\nwife lived in a dug-out for a time; later, selling out to a Mr. Sawyer,\\r\\nthey moved to Jefferson Prairie and ultimately to Cresco, Iowa. Aanund\\r\\nBjoin died in 1847; the son Halvor, then eighteen years old, walked to\\r\\nKoshkonong with the view of selecting land and settling there, and the\\r\\nrest of the family moved there that same year. Johan Landsverk, who was\\r\\na brother of Ole Landsverk, an immigrant of 1838, settled on Yorkville\\r\\nPrairie and remained there till 1854, when he moved to Sande in\\r\\nChickasaw County, Iowa, where he lived till his death. A son, Peder J.\\r\\nLandsverk, born 1840, occupied the homestead later; he died in January,\\r\\n1908. Hermo Nilson Tufte and family located on section 31 in Raymond\\r\\nTownship; here he lived till his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been said, Tufte came from Aal Parish, Hallingdal, and was\\r\\nnot only the first emigrant to America from Aal, but it seems, also\\r\\nthe first from the Valley of Hallingdal. The Tufte farm lay in the\\r\\nextreme north of the valley close up under the mountains; the region is\\r\\nextremely cold, much of it covered by snow the whole year round. The\\r\\nfamily was extremely poor; of a pious nature and fervid adherents of\\r\\nHans Nilsen Hauge. Besides the father and mother there was a son, Nils,\\r\\nand a daughter, Sigrid. The latter, in whom the piety of the mother\\r\\nhad found strong expression, was attracted to the young lay preacher,\\r\\nEielson, and in July the next year became his wife. The son, Nils,\\r\\nmarried in 1865 a daughter of Ole Sanderson in Perry Township, Dane\\r\\nCounty, and lived on the old homestead until he died about 1901. The\\r\\ndaughter, Julia, married Thomas Adland of North Cape, Racine County,\\r\\nand another daughter, Betsey, married O. B. Dahle of Perry, Dane\\r\\nCounty. Hermo Nilson and his wife both died in the latter part of the\\r\\nsixties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree different parties of immigrants, nearly all from Telemarken, came\\r\\nto Racine County in 1843. One, the so-called Wigeland party, left Skien\\r\\nearly in the spring by ship commanded by Captain Bloom, sailing to\\r\\nHavre, France. The second party, going about the same time, sailed out\\r\\nfrom Skien by the _Olius_, Captain Björnson, also going to Havre. Of\\r\\nthe third party we shall speak below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Havre those in the first party seem to have engaged passage on an\\r\\nAmerican ship _Argo_, a five-masted sailing vessel loaded with Swedish\\r\\niron bound for New York. While _Olius_ was laid up for repairs, the\\r\\nAmerican captain began cutting prices, offering at last to take the\\r\\nnew arrivals to New York for nine five-franc pieces each (or about\\r\\n$8). Many did not dare to take passage on the _Argo_, fearing that\\r\\nsome trick was being played on them, but most of them went. _Argo_\\r\\nproved a good sailer, reaching New York four weeks ahead of _Olius_.\\r\\nThere were, however, long delays in New York and Buffalo, so that the\\r\\nimmigrants did not reach Milwaukee before August 15th. Among those who\\r\\ncame on the _Argo_ were: Arentz Wigeland and wife Gunild, his aged\\r\\nfather Andrew Wigeland, and his brothers George and Andrew, and two\\r\\nsisters; Halvor Pederson Haugholt, with wife Tone and four sons and two\\r\\ndaughters, Gunild and Ingeborg; Ole Overson Haukom and family, eleven\\r\\nin all; Anders Jacobson Rönningen, wife Kjersti and three sons;[289]\\r\\nJens Hundkjilen and Anders Smekaasa; Amund S. Sötholt, his brother,\\r\\nSören S. Sötholt, Sven S. Klomset; Lars Tinderholt; Nils H. Narum,\\r\\nHalvor Nisson, John Maaren, Nils Rue, John Kossin, John Husevold,\\r\\nall with families; Östen Ingusland, John Husevold, Hans Tveito,\\r\\nSvein Nordgaarden, Gjermon T. Nordgaarden, Mathias H. Kroken, wife\\r\\nand children, his wife\\'s sister Anne and their mother Sissel; Ole O.\\r\\nStorlie, with wife,[290] four sons and two daughters; Kjittil Haugan\\r\\nand family; Gunuld K. Maaren, Gro Grave and her mother; Halvor I.\\r\\nDoksrud, wife and two sons, Halvor and Ingebret. All these, about one\\r\\nhundred in all, were from different parts of Telemarken. Besides there\\r\\nwere sixteen persons from Sætersdalen as follows: Tollef Gunnufson\\r\\nHuset, wife Hæge Olson and six children from Bygland, Augun Berge and\\r\\nwife from Vallö, Kjögei Harstad from Vallö, Tollef Knudson and wife\\r\\nand three children from Holestad Parish, and Tolleif Röisland and Ole\\r\\nNummeland from Vallö, the first emigrants from Sætersdalen to America.\\r\\nAll but the last two of these went to Muskego.[291]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [289] One of whom, Jacob, now lives in Racine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [290] It was Mrs. Ole Storlie, who was accidentally shot by Sören\\r\\n        Bakke, which unfortunate event seems to have been the chief\\r\\n        cause why Bakke, almost crazed with grief, gave up pioneer\\r\\n        life and returned to Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [291] Röisland and Vigeland settled at Pine Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nArentz Wigeland, born 1812, who may be regarded as the leader, had\\r\\nsailed for seven years between Boston and the West Indies and along the\\r\\nAmerican Atlantic coast. Passing the winters in Boston he had learned\\r\\nthe English language, and in 1842 returned to his home in Bamle,\\r\\nNorway, to bring his family to America. He became the chief promoter of\\r\\nthe considerable immigration from Lower Telemarken that year. Wigeland\\r\\nsettled in Yorkville Township. In 1844 he married Gunild Pederson; he\\r\\ndied in 1862. The daughter Maren (b. 1845) married John W. Johnson in\\r\\n1865. Mrs. Wigeland died in Racine in 1897. Haugholt (b. 1799) was from\\r\\nSaude Parish in Lower Telemarken. He settled on section 18 in the Town\\r\\nof Raymond; there he died in 1882, his wife[292] died in 1876, aged\\r\\n79 years. Their oldest son Ole, who was drowned in the fifties in the\\r\\nNorway marshes, was the first person buried in the Yorkville Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [292] She was Gunild Wigeland; they were married in 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\nNels Narum was from Stathelle in Bamle Parish; he settled in Norway\\r\\nTownship on section 20. Both he and his wife died in 1887, about\\r\\neighty-seven years old. Hans Tveito (Twito) settled in the part of the\\r\\nsettlement that lay in Waukesha County; he moved to Houston County,\\r\\nMinnesota, in 1855 and in 1866 to Filmore County; Halvor Nissen who\\r\\nwas from Bamle, also settled in Waukesha County. Ole Overson was from\\r\\nHviteseid Parish; when they came to Norway they lived for some time\\r\\nwith John Dale (who had come from Norway in 1837 with Mons K. Aadland\\r\\nand Ole Rynning). In 1845 he preëmpted land in section 34, where his\\r\\nson Frank Overson lived until quite recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur third party of emigrants were from Upper Telemarken, mostly from\\r\\nSiljord Parish. They came on the ship _Vinterflid_.[293] Among those\\r\\nin the party were: Knud S. Kvistrud and Kari Berge from Tin, Egil O.\\r\\nCleven and family, and a cousin Knut Haugan, wife and two daughters\\r\\nfrom Langelev; Björn Stondal, Ole O. Hedejord[294] and wife Liv, three\\r\\ndaughters, Esther, Ida and Etta, and two sons, Ole and Edward; Torbjörn\\r\\nG. Vik and family, who later moved to Koshkonong; Aanund Drotning\\r\\nwho also went to Koshkonong that same year;[295] Aase and Ingeborg\\r\\nOlson[296] from Mandal, Telemarken. John Homme from Siljord, father\\r\\nof Reverend G. Homme, founder of the Indian School at Wittenberg,\\r\\nWisconsin, also came at the same time, as also Ole Myren and wife\\r\\nBergit, and Torgrim Busness and wife Anne from Tin, who moved to\\r\\nSpringfield Township, Winneshiek County, Iowa, in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [293] Many of the facts relative to this party were gathered on\\r\\n        a visit at the home of Mrs. Ingeborg Roswall, Whitewater,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, August 12, 1908; Mrs. Roswall does not remember\\r\\n        the name of the Captain of the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [294] Ole Hedejord died on Koshkonong; Liv is still living, with\\r\\n        her grandchildren on the old homestead, near Waterford, in\\r\\n        the Town of Yorkville.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [295] Edwin Drotning of Stoughton tells me that his father Anon\\r\\n        remained a while in Milwaukee before going to Koshkonong,\\r\\n        where he located, as we know in 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [296] These two sisters married Tostein and Gulleik Cleven in\\r\\n        1844. Tostein and Aase Cleven lived in Yorkville till 1866,\\r\\n        when they moved to Pleasant Spring, Dane County, Wisconsin.\\r\\n        Tostein died in 1893, Aase in 1905, leaving four daughters\\r\\n        and three sons: Mrs. Astri Drotning, Mrs. Ed. Drotning, both\\r\\n        of Stoughton, Wisconsin, Mrs. Anna Howe, Mrs. Edwin Bjoin,\\r\\n        Rice Lake, Wisconsin, Ed., Thomas, and Henry. Thomas Cleven\\r\\n        occupies the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year also Ole Heg, son of Even Heg and a brother of Colonel Hans\\r\\nC. Heg,[297] came and settled in Racine County, as also Knud Langeland\\r\\nfrom Samnanger, who in 1866 became the first editor of _Skandinaven_\\r\\nfounded that year by John Anderson in Chicago. Knud Langeland lived\\r\\nat first in Muskego, later at North Cape, Racine County. In 1849 he\\r\\nmarried Anna Hatlestad (born in Skjold Parish, Ryfylke, in 1830), whose\\r\\nparents Jens O. Hatlestad and wife Anne had immigrated in 1846, and\\r\\nsettled in the Town of Norway. Knud Langeland was also the first editor\\r\\nof _Amerika_, which began publication in Chicago in 1884. During the\\r\\nlast years of his life Langeland lived in North Cape and in Milwaukee,\\r\\nwhere he died in 1888; his wife died in 1908, at the home of her\\r\\nson, Dr. Peter Langeland with whom she had lived since her husband\\'s\\r\\ndeath.[298]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [297] Ole Heg is still living in Burlington, Racine County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [298] The other children are James, Charles, and Frank Langeland,\\r\\n        and Mrs. Harry Brimble of Chicago, and Leroy Langeland, who\\r\\n        is news editor of the _Evening Wisconsin_, Milwaukee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came three persons from Voss to Racine County in 1843, namely,\\r\\nKnut S. Skjerve (b. 1808), and wife Kari, and his unmarried sister,\\r\\nBrita Selheim. Skjerve located in Norway, Racine County, in the\\r\\nneighborhood of Nils Johnson. In 1847 Skjerve sold his land to Knut\\r\\nK. Aaretuen from Sogn and went to Jefferson Prairie, Boone County,\\r\\nIllinois, where he bought a farm and lived till his death in 1892; his\\r\\nwife died there in 1873.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1844-1846 the increase in immigration was constant, though not\\r\\nlarge. In 1847 there arrived a considerable number. The scattered\\r\\naccessions of these years represent as widely removed parishes as\\r\\nSkien, Lærdal in Sogn, and Namsos in Trondhjem. The following is a\\r\\npartial list: 1844, John Larson and Peter Jacobson and family from\\r\\nStathelle, Bamle, Johannes J. Quala from near Stavanger; Thormod S.\\r\\nFlattre with wife Ingeborg (Lydahl)[299] and children from Voss, who\\r\\nsettled in Norway Township, Halvor O. Skare and wife Margrete and two\\r\\nchildren from Lower Telemarken, who located in Norway Township in\\r\\n1845;[300] John I. Berge and wife Julia, and Hans H. Bakke and wife\\r\\nIngeborg, who moved to Spring Grove in 1854, and Peder Torgerson\\r\\nand wife Anne and five children from Kragerö.[301] In 1846: Jens\\r\\nO. Hatlestad and wife (see above page 284) parents of Rev. O. J.\\r\\nHatlestad, pioneer publisher, minister, and author of _Historiske\\r\\nMiddelelser om den norske Augustana-Synode_, Decorah, Iowa, 1877;\\r\\nElling Spillom, wife Maren and three sons, Ole, Hendrik, and Mikkel and\\r\\none daughter; Ole Homstad and Mathias Homstad, both with families, from\\r\\nNamsos in Trondhjem Diocese;[302] they settled in Raymond Township;\\r\\nHalvor and Ingebret Roswald[303] from Gjerpen. Knudt K. Hedle, wife\\r\\nand sons Mathias, Peter, and daughter Betsy from Lærdal, Sogn; Tyke\\r\\nHendrikson Lökken and wife Anne from Gjerpen, who bought the Aslak Aas\\r\\nfarm in Norway Township; they had four children, Hans, Ole, Peter and\\r\\nMaria.[304] In 1847: Peter M. Andsion from Namsos, with wife and four\\r\\nchildren (three daughters and a son); they settled in Norway Township.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [299] Thomas F. Thompson, who died in Leland, Illinois, in 1908,\\r\\n        was their son.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [300] He moved to Winchester, Wisconsin, in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [301] Torgerson removed to Wheeler Prairie, Dane County, in 1846.\\r\\n        One of the children Anne Tomine, married Ole C. Erikson in\\r\\n        1854 and they moved to Lake Mills, Jefferson County. In the\\r\\n        spring of 1867 they moved to Stoughton, Wisconsin, where\\r\\n        Erikson was one of the first promoters of the Stoughton Wagon\\r\\n        Company. Mrs. Erikson is still living in Stoughton.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [302] They were the first families to emigrate from Trondhjem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [303] Ingebret Roswald married Ingeborg Cleven in 1854, and they\\r\\n        then settled in Dodge County. The widow is now living in\\r\\n        Whitewater, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [304] Hans died in 1856, Ole died in Milwaukee in 1901. Peter\\r\\n        Hendrikson graduated from Beloit College, held a chair in\\r\\n        Modern Languages there for about ten years, was later editor\\r\\n        of _Skandinaven_ and Principal of Albion Academy, Albion,\\r\\n        Wisconsin. Is now engaged in farming in the State of Maine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this year Captain Hans Friis from Farsund, Agder, Norway, settled in\\r\\nMuskego. Friis was a sailor with _Enigheden_ in 1837 (see above page\\r\\n96), and between 1837 and 1847 had made nine journeys to America. After\\r\\nsettling in Muskego he continued for many years sailing on the Great\\r\\nLakes. In 1848 the following came to Muskego: George J. Björgaas from\\r\\nHoug, Voss,[305] Tollef O. Öien from Tönset, Österdalen (removed to\\r\\nKewanee County in 1855), and J. H. Skarie, from Hadeland, who located\\r\\nin Town of Norway. This year also brought to Muskego the pioneer\\r\\nminister Hans Andreas Stub (b. 1822), who had that spring received and\\r\\naccepted the call to the Muskego church. Knut and Anna Aaretuen from\\r\\nAurland, Sogn, also appear among the number; they bought the farm of\\r\\nKnut S. Skjerve in Norway Township. In 1854 they moved to Winneshiek\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, and about 1860 to Gilmore County, Minnesota. John T. and\\r\\nChristoffer Olson from Romskogen in Rödenæs, Halvor \"Modum\" from Modum,\\r\\nNorway, and Guro Wait and son Reuben from Österdalen, Norway, all came\\r\\nin 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [305] His parents with family of ten came in 1849. George Björgaas\\r\\n        moved to Adams County, in 1849, where he has lived since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brief outline of the growth of the settlement represents fairly\\r\\ncompletely the increase by immigration from Norway between 1842 and\\r\\n1850. The wave of migration had long ago moved westward; it had\\r\\nalready gone beyond Koshkonong also. It was northern and western\\r\\nDane County and southern Columbia County that were now the Mecca of\\r\\nimmigrants. In the meantime some small settlements in Walworth and\\r\\nJefferson Counties had already been founded. We shall, therefore,\\r\\nbriefly discuss these now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n           _The Heart Prairie Settlement in Walworth County,\\r\\n                   Wisconsin. Skoponong. Pine Lake._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWalworth County forms one of the southern tier of counties in\\r\\nWisconsin, being situated between Rock on the west and Kenosha and\\r\\nRacine on the east; to the north lies Jefferson County. There are four\\r\\nNorwegian settlements in the county, as follows: (1) in the southern\\r\\npart of the Town of Whitewater and the northern part of the Town of\\r\\nRichmond lies the Heart Prairie Settlement, taking its name from the\\r\\nbeautiful little prairie directly east of it; (2) about four miles east\\r\\nof the city of Whitewater lies Skoponong, partly in Whitewater Township\\r\\nand extending north into Jefferson County as far as Palmyra; (3) in\\r\\nthe city of Whitewater there is a considerable Norwegian colony, and\\r\\n(4) about six miles southeast of Heart Prairie lies the Sugar Creek\\r\\nSettlement, extending from about five miles north of Delavan to about\\r\\nthree miles northeast of Elk Horn, the county seat of Walworth County.\\r\\nIt is the first of these settlements that we shall discuss in this\\r\\nchapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settlers at Heart Prairie were Ole A. Sögal and\\r\\nwife Kari, who, with their four children Anne, Andrea, Karen, and\\r\\nJohanne, came in 1842 and located four miles and a half southeast of\\r\\nthe city of Whitewater. They lived there only a few years, however,\\r\\nthen moved to Wautoma, Waushara County, in Central Wisconsin. The next\\r\\nsettler was Ole\\'s brother, Hans A. Milebon, who with his wife Kari came\\r\\nin 1843, and settled about a mile north of his brother\\'s place; they\\r\\nhad one daughter, Mary Ann, who was about three years old when they\\r\\ncame, and who is still living near Whitewater.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1844 a number of families arrived from Norway and\\r\\nsettled at Heart Prairie. They were as follows: Hans Arveson Vale and\\r\\nwife Aaste (Esther), with children Arve (or Harvey) and Isak. Mr.\\r\\nArveson bought his first eighty acres at government price of $1.25\\r\\nper acre, and built his log house in the fall of 1844. In this log\\r\\ncabin many a Norwegian immigrant found a temporary home upon his\\r\\nfirst arrival in Wisconsin in the early days of the settlement. Here\\r\\nMr. Arveson lived, cultivating his own farm, until his death in 1873\\r\\nat the age of sixty-one; the widow died in June, 1900, at the age\\r\\nof eighty-six. Hans Thompson and wife Marie also came in 1844; they\\r\\nhad three children, Thomas, Karen and Ann. He bought land adjoining\\r\\nArveson\\'s farm, lived the first winter in a dug-out. But the next\\r\\nspring \"when the snakes began to come in,\" writes my informant, they\\r\\nmoved to the Arveson\\'s where they lived till they got their log-house\\r\\nbuilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndres J. Skipnes and his wife Aaste also came at the time; they\\r\\nsettled near Ole Arveson, but lived there only a short time, then\\r\\nmoved to a farm near Stoughton, Wisconsin. Ole J. Vale and wife Anne\\r\\nlikewise came in the same party, but they went to Sugar Creek, where\\r\\na son, John, and a daughter, Annie Torine, had located the year\\r\\nbefore.[306] Another arrival at this time was Peder H. Swerge, and Ole\\r\\nTölvson Grönsteen and wife Kari and three children, Tosten Olson, a\\r\\ncarpenter, and wife Aaste, Karine, a daughter of Halvor Anderson, came\\r\\nin 1844. Tosten built most of the log-cabins that were erected in the\\r\\nsettlement for a number of years. His wife died soon after coming to\\r\\nAmerica, and Tosten died in the Civil War. Finally the accessions of\\r\\n1844 included also the following persons: Gunder H. Lunde, Anne Kosa,\\r\\nOle O. Huset and family, John C. Opsal, and Halvor Huset. The latter\\r\\ntwo remained only a short time, then went west; Ole O. Huset located on\\r\\nKoshkonong.[307]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [306] The rest of their children who came with them were Aaste, a\\r\\n        widow, Andrea, Anders, and Anne Christine.\\r\\nThomas Thompson married Mary Ann, daughter of Christen Mason. They\\r\\nlived on the Thompson homestead till their death; Thomas died in 1869,\\r\\nhis wife in 1871. They had six children, of whom Hans, the oldest,\\r\\nlives at Forest City, Iowa. Karen Thompson, oldest daughter of Hans\\r\\nThompson, married Jens Skipnes (better known as John A. Johnson of\\r\\nthe firm, Fuller and Johnson, Madison, Wisconsin), and with him lived\\r\\nnear Stoughton, Wisconsin, where she died about four years after their\\r\\nmarriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [307] See Koshkonong Church Register, page 324 below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the above thirty-one persons who emigrated in 1844 were from the\\r\\nvicinity of Skien in Holden, and all came on the same ship, namely,\\r\\n_Salvator_, Captain Johan Gasman. They were nine weeks on the ocean,\\r\\nlanding in New York July 4th; they came by the regular route to\\r\\nMilwaukee, thence they drove in lumber wagons to Heart Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the year 1845 the following accessions are to be noted: The\\r\\nbrothers Nils and Gunder C. Opsal; Halvor A. Lunde and wife Ann and\\r\\nsix children, most of them grown up, and another son Gulleik and wife\\r\\nDorothea; Anders J. Björndokken; Johans Grönsteen with wife Maria and\\r\\nthree children. For 1846 we note the following: Anders Gunderson, John\\r\\nArveson and wife Kjersti and four children;[308] Lukas Ingebretson;\\r\\nAnders G. Bjerva, wife Anne and four children:[309] Anne, Börte Maria,\\r\\nKaren, and Jens, who many years ago moved to Crookston, Minnesota; and\\r\\nJohn Grönsteen and wife Asberg. All those who came during the years\\r\\n1845-46 were from near Skien.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [308] The mother and one child died that same fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [309] She was a widow when he married her. The children of the\\r\\n        second marriage were: Gunder, Christen (Whitewater), Esther\\r\\n        (who was Mrs. Chas. Sobye, Stoughton, Wisconsin, but now\\r\\n        dead). Anders Bjerva and wife died many years ago.\\r\\nIn 1847 Christen M. Bö, wife Inger and four children from Gjerpen came\\r\\nto Heart Prairie; and in 1848 came Ole Nilsen from Christiansand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn either 1848 or 1849 came Nils, Steen and Ole Haatvedt; Nils moved\\r\\nto Wautoma, and Ole settled in Waupaca after living a few years at\\r\\nHeart Prairie. In 1850 Hans Hanson, a blacksmith, came from Holdon and\\r\\nlocated there; he worked for a time with the George Esterly Harvesting\\r\\nMachine Co., then bought a farm, which he occupied till his death\\r\\nin 1893. Another blacksmith by the name of Claus Hanson came at the\\r\\nsame time; worked at his trade for a while in Whitewater then went to\\r\\nMichigan, married and came back and settled in Milwaukee, where he is\\r\\nstill living. In 1851 Arve Gunderson Vale emigrated; his son Hans Vale\\r\\nhad come in 1844; Arve Vale lived only a week after arriving. With him\\r\\ncame Gunder H. Vala and wife Kersti and seven children; they moved to\\r\\nVermillion, South Dakota, a few years later, all except the oldest\\r\\nson Halvor, who is living at Rio, Wisconsin. In that year (1851) came\\r\\nalso Christopher Steenson Haatvedt and his two brothers-in-law, Peter\\r\\nKystelson Haatvedt and Christen J. Tveit, while in 1852 came Jörgen A.\\r\\nNilson Vibito and wife Karen Kristine, née Hanson, and six children.\\r\\nJörgen Nilson had taught parochial school in Norway for twenty-nine\\r\\nyears and continued to do so here for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is a complete account of all arrivals to the settlement from\\r\\nNorway down to the year 1852; the roster of settlers here given has\\r\\nbeen patiently gathered during several months of research by Mr. Harvey\\r\\nArveson[310] of Whitewater, himself the oldest son of the third settler\\r\\nin the community, namely Hans Arveson Vale, of whom we have spoken\\r\\nabove. I have followed his manuscript closely, omitting only certain\\r\\nfacts of family and personal history. Mr. Arveson speaks briefly of\\r\\nthe trying summer and fall of 1846 when for a time sickness and death\\r\\nseemed to threaten to exterminate the settlers of Heart Prairie. I\\r\\nwill quote from his own account of the condition; speaking of John\\r\\nGrönsteen, who came in 1846 and died that same fall, he continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n  There was so much sickness here at that time that there was hardly\\r\\n  any one well enough to bury those that died; and well can I\\r\\n  remember that the men had to come down to our house and rest before\\r\\n  they could finish the grave, and well can I remember that the cow\\r\\n  stood outside bellowing to be milked and no one able to milk her;\\r\\n  everybody was thirsty as all had fever and ague and had to go a\\r\\n  mile for water before we got to the well, and sometimes no one able\\r\\n  to go after it. I am sure a great many died for want of care, as\\r\\n  there was none that understood the English language and did not\\r\\n  understand how to take their medicine. Those were hard times, and\\r\\n  to many this account may sound incredible; nevertheless, it is true\\r\\n  and I could write volumes and tell true incidents of the trials and\\r\\n  hardships that the old pioneers had to endure.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [310] I acknowledge here with gratitude Mr. Arveson\\'s valuable aid.\\r\\n        It is only through such intelligent interest and patient effort\\r\\n        on the part of the sons of the pioneers themselves, who have\\r\\n        continued to live in the community, that such reliable facts\\r\\n        can be secured.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitewater city received no Norwegian settlers until in the fifties,\\r\\ntherefore an account of their coming falls outside the scope of our\\r\\ndiscussion. Of the old Skoponong Settlement I am able to give only\\r\\na few general facts. The first settlers came in 1843-44; they were:\\r\\nKittil Jordgrev, Hans Bukaasa, and Björn Lien from Upper Telemarken,\\r\\nHans and Harald Nordbö from Flaa, Hallingdal, Ole Lia from Hiterdal,\\r\\nHalvor Valkaasa from Sauland, Lars Johnson Lee, Sjur Hydle, Knut T.\\r\\nRio, and Tollef Grane from Voss, and Anon Dalos; several of these\\r\\nhad families. Lars Lee and wife Britha came to Muskego in the summer\\r\\nof 1843 and to Skoponong early in the fall, and were therefore among\\r\\nthe very earliest in that locality. They lived there until 1861, when\\r\\nthey located at Spring Prairie, Town of Leeds, Columbia County.[311]\\r\\nIn his history of the Skoponong Congregation (founded in 1844), C. M.\\r\\nMason, Secretary of the congregation, names also the following among\\r\\nthe earliest members of the church: Halvor Mathison (in whose house the\\r\\nchurch was organized in 1844), Styrk Erikson, Knud Dokstad, Nils Herre,\\r\\nOle Sjurson, Simon Sakrison, Jacob Kaasne, Halvor Glenna, Mathias\\r\\nBaura, Björn Hefte, Sjur Flittre, Lars Klove, Mathias Lia and Even\\r\\nGulseth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [311] Lars Lee died in 1883, his wife in 1905. Dr. Lewis Johnson Lee\\r\\n        of De Forest, Wisconsin, is their son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 Syver O. Haaland, wife and nine children, Hadle Evenson\\r\\nand wife Anne J. Fjösne, and Tostein H. and Osmond O. Högstul came\\r\\nto Skoponong, the latter two from Tuddal in Telemarken; the former\\r\\nwere from Etne Parish in Söndhordland. Björn Holland of Hollandale,\\r\\nWisconsin, who is a son of Syver Haaland,[312] writes me that they came\\r\\non the ship _Kong Sverre_ from Bergen.[313] In Ulvestad\\'s _Nordmaendene\\r\\ni Amerika_, page 56, appears an account of their first few weeks in\\r\\nthe settlement and of S. Haaland\\'s sickness and death. The Högstul\\r\\nparty came in a brig by the name of _Washington_, which carried iron\\r\\nfrom Tvedestrand, commanded by a Norwegian captain by the name of Simon\\r\\nCook. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"In Milwaukee, there were only a few stores at the time. We drove\\r\\n  with oxen and a wagon to the so-called Skoponong Settlement near\\r\\n  Whitewater. When we came there nearly all the settlers lay ill with\\r\\n  ague, the condition was wretched. We immediately began to rid and\\r\\n  break some land and after a while we got so far that we could raise\\r\\n  some wheat. But we had to haul it fifty miles to Milwaukee with\\r\\n  oxen; there we got 25 cents per bushel.... wages was usually 25\\r\\n  cents a day in the spring and fall; in the haying it was 50 cents.\\r\\n  But there was little work to get. Like other settlers my parents\\r\\n  were poor. My mother made baskets from withes; these she then\\r\\n  carried on her back about the prairie and sold them to Americans,\\r\\n  getting in return for them flour, pork and garments, in order that\\r\\n  we should not suffer distress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [312] The family changed the name to Holland in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [313] Letter of May 5, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nHadle Evenson moved to Perry, Wisconsin, in 1854, where Mrs. Evenson\\r\\ndied in 1861. The oldest son Edwin Hadley, enlisting in Co. E, 15th\\r\\nWisconsin, was killed at the Battle of New Hope Church, Georgia, in\\r\\nMay, 1864. In 1875 Mr. Evenson settled at Slater, Story County, Iowa.\\r\\nPeter Hadley, Treasurer of Webster County, is the only surviving son.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the early settlers at Skoponong was Mrs. Ingeborg Nelson who came\\r\\nfrom Evanger, Voss, in 1849. She left Skoponong a few years later,\\r\\nsettling permanently at Deerfield, Dane County, in 1853, where she\\r\\nis still living at the age of ninety-five. Mrs. Nelson is the mother\\r\\nof Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota, who was born in Norway in 1843.\\r\\nKnute Nelson was educated at Albion Academy, Albion, Wisconsin, and\\r\\nremoved to Alexandria, Minnesota in 1871. He was Governor of Minnesota\\r\\nduring 1892-1895. In the latter year he was elected U. S. Senator and\\r\\nhas been reëlected twice since, serving now his third term.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall mention one more settler, namely Torstein Rio,[314] born at\\r\\nVossevangen in 1835, who, with his wife Ingeborg (Bershaugen) and\\r\\nfamily came to America in 1849 on the ship _Henrik Wergeland_ and\\r\\nlocated at Skoponong. A brother whose name also was Torstein came at\\r\\nthe same time, and the family included a son Nels (Thompson), who is\\r\\nliving at Madison, Wisconsin, having moved there in 1860.[315] Torstein\\r\\nRio died at Skoponong in 1869, his wife died in Madison in 1876.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [314] Father of Knut Rio.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [315] In 1880 Nels Thompson became a member of the well known firm of\\r\\n        clothiers, Boley, Hinrichs and Thompson, later Hinrichs and\\r\\n        Thompson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Pine Lake and Nashota in northwestern Waukesha County a considerable\\r\\nnumber of Norwegians lived among the forties and fifties, since which\\r\\nthe settlement has dwindled very much.[316] At Pine Lake the first\\r\\nSwedish settlement founded in America in the last century had been\\r\\nestablished in 1841 by Gustav Unonius.[317] In 1843 about fifty\\r\\nNorwegian families located at Pine Lake, according to Unonius _Minnen_,\\r\\n1862, page 3. Unonius mentions especially a Captain Hans Gasman as\\r\\nthe principal figure there. Gasman had a large family of sons and\\r\\ndaughters, and the name is a well known one among the early pioneers\\r\\nof Racine, Waukesha, and Dodge Counties.[318] Other members of the\\r\\nfamily were Charles, Peter and Captain Johan Gasman, who commanded the\\r\\n_Salvator_, plying between Skien and New York. This very ship brought\\r\\na number who located at Pine Lake, among them Halvor Salveson from\\r\\nGjerpen.[319]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [316] Or rather also in part Americanized.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [317] I have discussed this in my _Chapters on Scandinavian\\r\\n        Immigration_ (1906), pages 83-85.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [318] Into this county the settlement extended to and about Ashippun\\r\\n        and Toland.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [319] Many of those who came with Capt. Gasman this time went to\\r\\n        Heart Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the fifty families who came to Pine Lake in 1843 I may name\\r\\nEngelbret Salveson from Gjerpen, Erik Helgeson, Hans Roe, Christen\\r\\nPuttekaasa, Halvor Rosholt, Jacob Rosholt, Peter Næs from near\\r\\nSkien and Gjerpen, Ellef Björnson and Halvor Halvorson from Saude,\\r\\nTelemarken, and Tollef Waller from Eidanger in Lower Telemarken,\\r\\nChristopher Aamodt and Hans Uhlen from Modum, Tolleiv Röisland and Ole\\r\\nNummeland from Vallö in Sætersdalen and Ole Lia from Gausdal.[320]\\r\\nSome of these, as e. g. Halvor Halvorson[321] located in the extreme\\r\\nnorthern part of the settlement at Toland, and John Lia settled across\\r\\nthe Jefferson County line,[322] but most located in Waukesha County at\\r\\nHartland or Nashota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [320] Holand _De norske Settlementers Historie_, page 170, to which\\r\\n        I am indebted chiefly for this roll of immigrants to Nashota,\\r\\n        etc., in 1843.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [321] Halvorson died in the spring of 1908 as the last of the\\r\\n        original Norwegian settlers at Toland; he was born in 1818,\\r\\n        married in 1848 Kirsten Aandrud, who survives him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent years there arrived constantly new settlers from Skien,\\r\\nSætersdal and Gudbrandsdalen, but even in the later forties many began\\r\\nto go to the counties immediately northwest to Waupaca and Portage\\r\\ncounties and elsewhere. In 1850-54 these counties, as also Waushara and\\r\\nWinnebago counties on the south, received hosts of Norwegian settlers,\\r\\nsome coming direct from Norway, a large number however from Racine and\\r\\nDane Counties, and the Pine Lake region.[323] The period of growth\\r\\nin this settlement was therefore relatively short, and the removals\\r\\nrelatively large. The result was that the Norwegians came to live more\\r\\nscattered and the community soon began to lose its distinctive national\\r\\ncharacter. Thus it is significant, that of the ninety services held\\r\\nduring 1907 in _Vor Frelsers Kirke_ at Oconomowoc sixty-three were in\\r\\nthe English language.[324] But we are here touching upon questions\\r\\nwhich it is not our purpose to discuss in connection with the survey of\\r\\nsettlement.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [322] Through John Lia\\'s influence this then came to be the\\r\\n        destination of the earliest emigrants from Gudbrandsdalen\\r\\n        between 1846-49.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [323] Walworth County contributed some of the number; thus Ole\\r\\n        Sögal, the first Norwegian settler at Heart Prairie, was one\\r\\n        of those who went to Waushara County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [324] By way of comparison the number of English services to\\r\\n        Norwegian as far as statistics are available were in the\\r\\n        following localities: Morris, Ill., 13 of 67, Blue Mounds,\\r\\n        Dane Co., Wis., 0 of 22; Leland, Ill., 14 of 28; Stoughton,\\r\\n        Wis., 35 of 80; Long Prairie, 7 of 25; Koshkonong, 0 of 75;\\r\\n        \"Muskego,\" 41 of 112.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n   _The Earliest Norwegian Settlers at Sugar Creek, Walworth County,\\r\\n    Wisconsin. The influx from Land, Norway, to Wiota and Vicinity,\\r\\n                               1844-1852_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have briefly referred to Sugar Creek, Walworth County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nin chapter XXXIII above. This little settlement received its first\\r\\nNorwegian settlers in 1844 when Ole Vale and wife Anne from Holden\\r\\nParish, Skien, located there; with them came the sons John and Anders\\r\\nand the daughters Aasta, Anne, Turine, Andrea and Maria. Vale and his\\r\\nwife lived in Sugar Creek till their death, and the daughters all\\r\\nmarried and settled there. In the same year Ole Kittelson and Nils\\r\\nT. Kvamodden, both unmarried and both also from Holden, came to the\\r\\nsettlement. Ole Kittelson located permanently in Sugar Creek, but Nils\\r\\nKvamodden and wife moved to Norway Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota,\\r\\nin 1857. There they died years ago, the homestead being now occupied by\\r\\nthe son Ole.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian L. Vestremo and wife Ingeborg and three children, and Gunder\\r\\nK. Næseth emigrated from Gjerpen near Skien, in 1844. Næseth moved\\r\\nto Norway, Minnesota, in 1856 and Vestremo in 1857. According to Ole\\r\\nJacobson of Elk Horn, to whom I am indebted for these facts, there\\r\\nwere no further accessions to the colony before 1847. In that year\\r\\nhis parents came from Gjerpen, as also Jacob Torstenson and wife Maren\\r\\nMargrete and three sons Ole, Torsten and Jacob, and a daughter, Maria\\r\\nwith her husband Lars Jensen Teigen and family. With them came also\\r\\nTeigen\\'s mother. Jacob Torstenson died in 1861; the widow is still\\r\\nliving at the old home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Jacobson writes me that his father and family left Skien in April\\r\\nby the ship _Axel (og) Valborg_, Captain Bloom, going first as far as\\r\\nHavre, France. There they waited three weeks, then secured passage\\r\\nwith an American ship, the journey being very slow. Landing in Boston,\\r\\nthey went by train to Albany, thence by canal boat to Buffalo, and by\\r\\nsteamboat via the lakes to Milwaukee, where they arrived sometime in\\r\\nAugust. From Milwaukee they thereupon proceeded to Sugar Creek, where\\r\\nthey located permanently. Ole Jacobson is at present living on the farm\\r\\npurchased in 1847. In 1849 Aslak Rasmusson Slettene with wife Gunild\\r\\nand eight children came from Gjerpen, Norway.[325] Grindemelum, with\\r\\nwife, son, and daughter, also came in 1849, as did Peter J. Gromstulen,\\r\\nwife Svanang and five children, and Nils J. Overholt, wife and two\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [325] Some of the children have moved away, to Minnesota and\\r\\n        Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere do not seem to have been any further accessions of Norwegian\\r\\nimmigrants during the pioneer days of the Sugar Creek settlement. In\\r\\nthe sixties quite a number came and located at and about Elk Horn but\\r\\nthese do not fall within the scope of our survey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original home of immigrants from Land, Norway, was Rock Prairie, as\\r\\nwe saw above, chapter XXIV. From this as their distribution point they\\r\\nmigrated west and north, aiding in the founding of other settlements.\\r\\nAs early as 1844 we find one pioneer at Wiota from Land, Norway, namely\\r\\nSyver Johnson Smed (see above page 213). But the influx from Land did\\r\\nnot begin until 1847.[326] In that year two families, numbering in\\r\\nall fourteen persons, arrived via Rock Prairie; they were those of\\r\\nSvend Nörstelien (wife Karen, and five children) and of the widow Kari\\r\\nLillebæk, who had six children.[327] In 1848 Hovel Tollefsrude, wife\\r\\nBertha and children: Christopher, Hans, Jahannes, Siri, and Lovise\\r\\narrived. Further immigrants of that year were: Johannes Brenom, wife\\r\\nIngeborg and three children; Hans Halvorson (Brenna), wife Eli, and\\r\\nchildren, Berte, Halvor and Johannes; Johannes E. Smedsrud, with wife\\r\\nAnne and two sons Engebret and Mathias; and Johannes Smehögen (or Smed)\\r\\nwith wife Engeborg, and two children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [326] Matthew J. Ingebretson of Gratiot, Wis., who came to Wiota\\r\\n        with his parents in 1848, has kindly aided me with many of\\r\\n        the facts on immigration to Wiota in 1847-50.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [327] John Larsen Lillebæk was one of her sons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849 came Torkild Husværet, with wife and three sons, Gulbrand, Lars\\r\\nand Frederik; Ole Monson Tollefsrude, wife Karen and three children,\\r\\nand Nils Aason, Ovre Hasle and wife Ingeborg, who had come to Rock\\r\\nPrairie in 1848 (removed to Wiota in 1848). Hans Lillebæk came in 1850\\r\\nand about twenty in all in 1851-52.\\r\\n\\r\\nOle Monson, whom we have mentioned as coming in 1849, was the builder\\r\\nof the old Norwegian church at Wiota, which is still standing; the\\r\\npresent larger and more commodious structure stands on the wall built\\r\\nby Ole Monson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were not very many from other provinces in Norway among those who\\r\\nemigrated to Wiota in the late forties. We have spoken of Ingebrigt\\r\\nFuglegjærdet\\'s coming in 1846 from Long Prairie, where he had lived two\\r\\nyears; he was from Vik, Sogn.[328]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [328] Ingebrigt Johnson removed to Town of Dane, Dane County,\\r\\n        Wisconsin, in 1851; there he lived till his death in 1893,\\r\\n        his wife having died in 1890. John J. Johnson, retired\\r\\n        farmer, of Lodi, Columbia County, Wisconsin, is their son, as\\r\\n        is also Joseph Johnson of Dane Township in Dane County.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Vik came Erik I. Haave and wife in 1847, while Harald Melland\\r\\nand wife Anne came from Telemarken. From Sigdal there came one family\\r\\nin 1848; Ellef (Alef) Johnson and wife Anne. The latter served in the\\r\\nCivil War, in Company G of the Twenty-Second Wisconsin Regiment.[329]\\r\\nIn 1872 he married Mary Larson,[330] of Blanchardville, La Fayette\\r\\nCounty, where they are now living.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [329] He was only sixteen when he enlisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [330] She was a daughter of Ole Larson, who served in the Third\\r\\n        Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, in the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may conclude this chapter by saying that Arne Vinje, whose name is\\r\\nso intimately interlinked with the history of the community, died in\\r\\n1903, having lived on the old homestead for sixty-two years. Of his\\r\\neight children, three are living: Peter S. Anderson, Newell, Iowa,\\r\\nDaniel K. Anderson and Mrs. Martha Brunkow of Woodford, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n             _Continued Immigration from Aurland, Sogn, to\\r\\n                Koshkonong. The Arrival of Settlers from\\r\\n                      Vik Parish, Sogn, in 1845._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1845-1846 immigration to Koshkonong from Laurdal, Vinje and\\r\\nMoe Parishes continued and a considerable number came from Flesberg.\\r\\nThe accessions from Laurdal, Moe, and Hvideseid for these years record\\r\\nthe end of a movement that began in 1843. But that which especially\\r\\ncharacterized the growth of the Koshkonong Settlement in 1845-1846 was\\r\\nthe extensive additions through immigrants from Sogn. So extensive,\\r\\nin fact, was the influx from Sogn these years as to make their total\\r\\nrepresentation on Koshkonong at once exceed that from either Voss or\\r\\nNumedal, and equal to about half that from Telemarken. These four have\\r\\never since been the dominant elements in Koshkonong\\'s population. A\\r\\npart of this immigration from Sogn was from parishes represented among\\r\\nthe arrivals of the year before. Such were Botolf J. Grinde, Ole N.\\r\\nSteenhjerde and Sjur I. Romören from Leikanger, Herman T. Vee, Joseph\\r\\nJ. Gjellum and Hermund O. Offerdal from Lærdal, Anders S. Övrebö,\\r\\nwife Anne and three children from Lyster, Erik L. Grov and Anders H.\\r\\nÖdegaard and wife Martha from Hafslo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut much more significant was the immigration from Aurland Parish in\\r\\n1845-1846, from Sogndal in 1846, and the new immigration from Vik\\r\\nParish in 1845. We shall discuss these three groups in order briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have noted above, Chapter XXXI, that there were several persons from\\r\\nAurland Parish, Sogn, among the immigrants who settled on Koshkonong in\\r\\n1844. I am now in receipt of a letter from Anders J. Flaam of Flaam in\\r\\nAurland, Norway, relative to the earliest emigration from Aurland to\\r\\nAmerica. His letter, as also that of Reverend E. P. Juul, the present\\r\\nMinister of the Parish, shows that the earliest emigrants left there in\\r\\n1844. I quote in translation from Reverend Juul\\'s letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Those who, according to parochial records here, were the first\\r\\n  to emigrate to America are the following: Iver Hansen Vingum, age\\r\\n  twenty-five, unmarried,[331] Ole Torjussen Flaam, age fifty, wife\\r\\n  Anna Botolfsdatter, age forty, and children, Ole, thirteen and a\\r\\n  half years old, and Anders, ten years. Of these, Iver Hansen\\'s\\r\\n  certificate of emigration is shown to have been issued March 20,\\r\\n  1844, and he to have left the district on April 13th the same year.\\r\\n  Ole Torjussen\\'s certificate of emigration was issued on the 13th of\\r\\n  April, 1844, and his departure took place the following day. All\\r\\n  therefore emigrated together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [331] The writer\\'s father has always pronounced the name Vangen, which\\r\\n        also according to Haakon Lie, is the correct form. Iver Vangen\\r\\n        settled on Bonnet Prairie, where his son Hans Vangen is still\\r\\n        living.\\r\\n\\r\\nReverend Juul thereupon gives a list of those who emigrated from\\r\\nAurland in 1845, and while several of these did not settle on\\r\\nKoshkonong it will be of interest to the reader to see this list. I\\r\\ntherefore give it complete here:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"In 1845, on the 19th of April the natives of Aurland\\r\\n  (Aurlændinger) left their native village: Torsten Olsen Bjelde,\\r\\n  (45 years of age) wife, Anna (29), and son, Ole (3½ years);\\r\\n  Iver Ingebrigtsen Ytreli (32 years); Jens Botolfsen Bergkvam\\r\\n  (23½ years); Jens Torgersen Tærum (44½ years), wife Ragnhilde\\r\\n  Monsdatter (27) and son Torger (one year); Sjur Olsen Stundal (19)\\r\\n  and sister Katrine (30); Anna Marie Hansdatter Vangen (28½);\\r\\n  Erik Johannesen Ytreli (43) and wife Marthe Larsdatter (48) and\\r\\n  children; Brita (21 years), Magnilde (18 years), Johannes (16\\r\\n  years), Ingeborg (14 years), Lars (10½ years), Haakon (9 years),\\r\\n  Anna (7 years), Tomas (5 years); Johanne Botolsdatter Ytreli (16\\r\\n  years); Eilef Olson Loven (24 years); Mikkel Knutsen Österbro\\r\\n  (22½ years), and wife Martha Gulvsdatter (27½ years), and son\\r\\n  Knut (two months); Lars Gundersen Gjellum (33½ years) and wife\\r\\n  Gjertrud, and son Knut (4 years); Martha Gundersdatter (17 years);\\r\\n  Josef Johannesen Vindedal (73 years), and wife Anna Jensdatter;\\r\\n  John Johnsen Frondal (28 years) and wife Magnhilde; Rognald\\r\\n  Johannesen Knit (19½ years); Simon A. Gjellum (20 years); Peder\\r\\n  Monsen Loven (34 years); Johanne M. Loven (20 years); Iver J. Stene\\r\\n  (22 years).\\r\\n\\r\\n  These are the emigrants who first went to America from this Parish.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Aurland Parish, January 25th, 1909.\\r\\n                                                         E. P. Juul.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the immigrants mentioned by Reverend Juul are still living\\r\\non Koshkonong. Thus among the children of Erik J. Ytreli (who died\\r\\nin 1892, at the age of 90),[332] Johannes (John E. Johnson) is still\\r\\nliving on the old homestead, two miles east of Utica, and his brother\\r\\nHaakon is living there with him.[333] Simon Gjellum lived two years\\r\\nin Chicago, then entered the Mexican War, after which he came to\\r\\nKoshkonong. Ivar I. Ytreli[334] had been a school teacher and deacon at\\r\\nSystrond, in which capacity he continued serving here in this country,\\r\\nat Rock Prairie, Rock County, whither he went soon after arriving in\\r\\nWisconsin; he died there about 1875. Of other immigrants from Aurland,\\r\\nwhich Mr. Anders J. Flaam speaks of, I shall mention Peder J. Gjeirsme,\\r\\nand Torbjörn O. Gjeirsme, wife Metta and family, who came in 1846, and\\r\\nHans Torjussen Flom, who, he says, went soon after Ole T. Flom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [332] The family shortened the name to Lie in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [333] During a visit with him at the John E. Johnson homestead last\\r\\n        August I had the pleasure of listening to H. Lie\\'s narrative\\r\\n        of the emigration of this party from Aurland and of their\\r\\n        early experiences. Haakon Lie has a remarkable memory and he\\r\\n        has made it a point to follow the career and keep in touch\\r\\n        with his fellow immigrants of 1845, and their history in this\\r\\n        country. Space does not permit me to give here details from\\r\\n        my interview with him, nor from that with others relative to\\r\\n        the immigration of these years. But I may add that the party\\r\\n        sailed with Kong Sverre, Captain Fisher; they were six weeks\\r\\n        and four days on the way from Bergen to New York, thence\\r\\n        they went by steamboat to Albany, where they arrived on the\\r\\n        fourth of July. Arriving in Chicago one of the last days in\\r\\n        July, they remained there a week then proceeded to their\\r\\n        destination, Koshkonong, driving with oxen from Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Haakon Lie says there were none on the ship from Telemarken or\\r\\n        Numedal; the 300 passengers were all from Sogn and Voss; but\\r\\n        I learn through others that there were some from Hardanger on\\r\\n        the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The limitations of space necessitates curtailment in the account\\r\\n        in nearly every chapter. From the vast amount of material I\\r\\n        have, I can offer here practically only that which pertains\\r\\n        specifically to the history of immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [334] Or, as Kristen Sherpi of West Koshkonong called him in an\\r\\n        interview last summer, Ivar i Heggvikji.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1845 there came also a group of immigrants to\\r\\nKoshkonong from Vik Parish, namely several families from near\\r\\nArnefjord. This party included several Næset families, the oldest\\r\\nliving survivor of which is Jens J. Næset (b. 1828), well-known\\r\\nKoshkonong architect, who resides at Stoughton, Wisconsin.[335] I have\\r\\nhad several interviews with Mr. Næset relative to their sailing, and\\r\\ntheir early life as pioneers; it will be possible to give here only\\r\\nthe briefest facts. Jens Næset tells me that there were eight estates\\r\\nat Næset and that the owners of four of them sold out at the same time\\r\\nand went to America. The biggest of these estates was that of Ingebrigt\\r\\nNæset, or as he was usually called, Skuungen. In the party were Jens\\r\\nNæset\\'s parents, Johannes Jensen Næset and wife Eli, his oldest sister\\r\\nGro, married to Ole Larson (Haugan)[336] who is living in Cambridge,\\r\\nWisconsin, two brothers Ingebrigt and John, and another sister who\\r\\nlater married Henrik Lien of East Koshkonong.[337]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [335] Jens Næset, I have just learned, died at Stoughton last week,\\r\\n        May, 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [336] They had one child when they came; she is Mrs. Ole Venaas,\\r\\n        Rockdale, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [337] Johannes Næset was born in Feios, but his father had bought\\r\\n        Næset in 1823 and settled there, three Norwegian miles from\\r\\n        Arnefjord.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three ships that sailed at the same time, Næset relates. One\\r\\nof these was the _Kong Sverre_, Captain Fischer (of which Haakon Lie\\r\\nspeaks above), and on which the emigrants from Aurland were embarked.\\r\\nAnother was a two-masted sloop, _Peder Schröder_, and which carried\\r\\nabout 130 passengers, among whom the Næset families; this sloop had\\r\\ncrossed twice before. The third was one commanded by Captain Brock. The\\r\\npassengers on this ship were mostly from Sogn, but there were three\\r\\nboys from Hardanger, and a few persons from Voss. _Peder Schröder_ also\\r\\ncarried emigrants principally from Sogn, but there were two from Voss,\\r\\nsays Næset. One of these was Brynjulf Leland, who settled at Norway\\r\\nGrove, where he is still living. The other was Odd Himle, whom we have\\r\\nmet with above page 168, as the guide of the first party of explorers\\r\\nof Koshkonong in 1839. He had returned to Norway in 1844, married there\\r\\nin 1845, and was now returning to America. Among those who came on the\\r\\nBrock-ship were Skuungen and Ole Menes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recognize in Captain Brook\\'s ship the same ship that Lasse Ellingson\\r\\nof Capron, Illinois, came on in 1845. It was furthermore the very\\r\\nsame voyage of this ship. The name of the ship was _Albion_. For a\\r\\npartial list of the passengers on this ship as of _Peder Schröder_,\\r\\nwhose captain was Vingaard,[338] the reader may now be referred to the\\r\\naccount of the sailing of these two ships above, Chapter XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [338] The much talked of Vingaard-ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ships _Kong Sverre_ and _Peder Schröder_ sailed side by side\\r\\nthe whole way, relates Næset, _Kong Sverre_ arriving in New York in\\r\\nthe evening, _Peder Schröder_ the next morning. Captain Brock\\'s ship\\r\\nwhich had started ten days earlier, arrived three days later (see above\\r\\npage 275). From New York the immigrants were taken over the usual route\\r\\nto Milwaukee.[339] Having arrived in Muskego, they secured Halvor\\r\\nLuraas to take their goods to Koshkonong; he brought them to Clinton\\r\\n(Rockdale), where the first man they met was Torstein Selseng, who\\r\\nhad emigrated from Aurland, Sogn, to Koshkonong the preceding year.\\r\\nJohannes Næset, who was a man of considerable means for the time,\\r\\nbought the land, which is now occupied by the son Ingebrigt Næset,\\r\\nwhich is section thirty-five in the southeastern part of Christiana\\r\\nTownship.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [339] Mr. Næset\\'s full account of this journey I shall publish\\r\\n        elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohannes Næset was born in Leikanger Parish in 1795; his wife,\\r\\nEli I. Berdahl, was born in 1797. She died in Koshkonong in 1850,\\r\\nJohannes died in 1882. He was noted for his ability as a mechanic, was\\r\\nsuccessful as a maker of violins, and was himself a capable player.\\r\\nJens Næset early distinguished himself as a builder and an architect.\\r\\nThough but sixteen years old he assisted in the building of the old log\\r\\nchurch in East Koshkonong in 1844, and it was Næset who took it down\\r\\nagain in 1858 and constructed the old stone church, which a few years\\r\\nago was replaced by a handsome brick edifice. He also built the tower\\r\\nof the old Liberty Prairie Church, and a number of the oldest houses on\\r\\nAlbion Prairie were erected by him. Jens Næset was married in 1850; he\\r\\nhas no children. Mrs. Ole Melaas of Stoughton, Wisconsin, is an adopted\\r\\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Næset.[340]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [340] The Næsets have been living in Stoughton since 1876.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been noted, there was a considerable immigration from Sogndal,\\r\\nSogn, in 1846; to name only a few: Ole C. Teigen, Ellend T. Quale,\\r\\nwith wife Dordei Baardsdatter and family, eight in all, Anders S.\\r\\nHundere, Nils O. Selseng and wife, and Johannes I. Gjerde. From\\r\\nAurland, Sogndal, and Hafslo there came others in the following four\\r\\nyears. I shall here name Peder Sylfestson Aaberge from Hafslo, who\\r\\ncame in 1847, Ole O. Anderson (1848), Ole O. Hemsing (1849), both from\\r\\nSogndal, Atle S. Gjellum and family, Per Sherping and wife Kristine and\\r\\nKristen Olson Gulvangen from Aurland in 1849. Of these Aaberge later\\r\\nmoved to Minnesota. Ole Anderson (often called Skog-Ola) settled three\\r\\nmiles north of Albion, where he lived till his death. He married Guri\\r\\nPederson, adoptive daughter of Torstein Selseng in 1851, who had come\\r\\nto America in 1849. She died in June, 1909. Ole Hemsing located first\\r\\nin Cottage Grove; in 1855 he purchased the old Hemsing farm three miles\\r\\nnorth of Stoughton, later owned by the son Ole H. Hemsing (b. 1853),\\r\\nsince 1884, of Stoughton, Wisconsin. Ole O. Hemsing died about 1895,\\r\\nthe widow (Ragnilda) died in 1907. Per Sherping died early and the\\r\\nwidow married Kristen Olson, who then took the name Sherping (Sherpi).\\r\\nKristen Sherpi (b. 1823) is still living at the old homestead near West\\r\\nKoshkonong Church. There was scattered immigration from Telemarken\\r\\ndown to 1850, especially from Hvideseid, about forty in all came from\\r\\nHallingdal, and twenty-five from Hardanger; Valders, Ringsaker, Biri\\r\\nand Vardal, and a dozen other provinces and parishes are represented\\r\\nby four or five settlers each. The first to arrive from Hardanger were\\r\\nSvend L. Lund, Ingebrekt, Nicolai, and Johannes Erdahl, Guttorm Buo,\\r\\nOle L. and Aslak E. Quammen; these came in 1847. From Ringsaker came\\r\\nAnders J. Tömmerstigen, wife Maria Olsdatter and children Johannes,\\r\\nOlive, Peter (b. 1843) and Karen Marie, in 1846, while from North\\r\\nAurdal in Valders came Ole Loe and Ole H. Hippe, both with families,\\r\\nand from Slidre, Tollef H. Gvale, all in 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall now offer a copy of the official register of members of the\\r\\nKoshkonong churches during this period, according to the Parochial\\r\\nRecords left by Reverend J. W. C. Dietrichson for the years 1844 to\\r\\n1850.

The first Norwegian in this section was Svennung\\r\\nNikkulson Dahle, who came from Flatdal in Telemarken in 1844 to\\r\\nKoshkonong, and the next year purchased land and settled near Norway\\r\\nGrove in the Town of Vienna. He was then only eighteen years old.[360]\\r\\nNearly all who came later were from Sogn, and Dahle was and remained\\r\\nthe only native of Telemarken in Vienna. In 1846 Erik Engesæter, from\\r\\nLeikanger, Sogn, with family, including a son John, settled there. In\\r\\n1847 Ole H. Farness (b. 1826) and wife Gertrude came from Sogn, Norway,\\r\\nto Norway Grove. Erik C. Farness[361] (b. 1828) also came the same\\r\\nyear. These men both acquired large farms there in the course of time,\\r\\nOle Farness owning 530 acres. Arne Boyum and family, five in all, from\\r\\nOuter Sogn, came in 1848 as did Knut K. Naas (b. 1810), with wife Alau\\r\\nand family of four children from Kragerö.[362]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [360] About 1858 he married Maline Öien (b. in Aardal, Sogn, in\\r\\n        1835). Svennung Dahle died in 1872, the owner of 400 acres of\\r\\n        land.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [361] He was married to Ingeborg Grinde in 1851, Rev. A. C. Preus\\r\\n        performing the ceremony. Ingeborg was the daughter of Botolf\\r\\n        Grinde who came from Sogn in 1846 and settled on Liberty\\r\\n        Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [362] Two sons, Thomas and Isak, went to the War in 1860. Thomas\\r\\n        was killed in the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862.\\r\\n        Knut Naas died in 1868; his wife in 1887.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian to buy land in Windsor Township was Ingebrigt\\r\\nLarson Tygum, from Systrand, Sogn, who immigrated in 1844, lived one\\r\\nyear in Muskego, then came to Windsor in 1845. For two years he seems\\r\\nto have been the only Norwegian in the Town.[363] In 1852 Tygum sold\\r\\nhis farm in Windsor and moved into Vienna Township, buying the farm\\r\\nat present occupied by the son Lars (b. 1849). In 1847 the following\\r\\nsettled in Windsor Township: Stephen Holum and family, who had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1845 and lived two years at Rock Prairie, Sjur Grinde\\r\\nand family, and Truls E. Farness and wife.[364] These families are\\r\\nintimately connected with the history of the Village of De Forest. A\\r\\nson of S. Holum, namely Ole S. Holum (b. 1847), lives on 204 acres\\r\\nof land adjoining the village. Ole Holum is a prominent democrat and\\r\\nhas held various offices of trust, being e. g. Register of Deeds in\\r\\n1877-78.[365] In 1848 several families moved in, among them Lars\\r\\nEggum, Ole Haukness and family (ten in all), and Sjur S. Vangness and\\r\\nfamily. Vangness had immigrated in 1844, first settled in Rock County,\\r\\nthen came to De Forest in 1848. He died there in 1878. The family\\r\\nincluded a son, Sjur S. Vangness (b. 1816 at Vangsness in Sogn), whom\\r\\nwe meet with later as a man of much influence in the township; he owned\\r\\n264 acres of land near De Forest.[366]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [363] Larson married Brita (Dale) widow of Jon Eiken on Rock\\r\\n        Prairie in 1847; she died in 1902, aged 89.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [364] Farness came from Balestrand Parish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [365] Farness died in 1885, his wife died in 1902 at the home of\\r\\n        her daughter, Mrs. H. T. Lerdall, Madison, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [366] As I shall not have occasion elsewhere to speak of the\\r\\n        Township of Burke directly south of Windsor, I may here say\\r\\n        that the first Norwegian settlers were Torkel Gullikson\\r\\n        (b. 1815) and wife Margarete, whom he had married in 1843;\\r\\n        they came to Pleasant Spring in 1844 and moved up to Burke\\r\\n        the following year. For several years there came no more\\r\\n        Norwegians.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bristol Township three families settled as early as 1846; namely\\r\\nthat of Botolf E. Bergum (b. 1816), who came there in the fall of 1846,\\r\\nand continued to reside there until his death in 1904 (his wife died\\r\\nin 1903; after a wedded life of fifty-four years),[367] Sjur Johnson\\r\\nand wife Ingeborg and one son, and Erik Larson and wife and several\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [367] They left five sons: Erik, Ellik, Peter, who live on Spring\\r\\n        Prairie, Marcus (Deerfield), and John, who lives in Cottage\\r\\n        Grove, and one daughter, Mrs. Peter Hagen, Spring Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1848 Hans H. Quamme came up to Bristol from Rock Prairie, where he\\r\\nhad settled in 1846, coming from Norway that year. During the next\\r\\nthree years so many immigrants came from Sogn and located in Norway\\r\\nGrove that the settlement came to be called \"Sogn.\" Among the many\\r\\nfamilies who located there at that time, John Ollis of Madison,\\r\\nWisconsin, writing in _Bygdejaevining_, page 341, names: \"Engesæther,\\r\\nGrinde, Farnes, Tygum, Eggum, Boyum, Huseböe, Hamre, Ohnstad, Slinde,\\r\\nSværen, Vangsness, Holum, Linde, Lidahl, Thorsnes, Fosse, Rendahl,\\r\\nEthun, Vigdahl, Ulvestad, Röisum, Svalem, Fjerstad, Henjum, Jerde,\\r\\nHaukeness,\" besides all who were called Olson, Larson, Nilson,\\r\\nAnderson, Peterson, Johnson, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten miles northwest of Norway Grove, at Lodi in Columbia County,\\r\\na smaller settlement of immigrants from Hardanger takes its beginning\\r\\nin 1847-48; although one family had settled there as early as 1844.\\r\\nIn that year Peder L. Ödvin (b. 1819) and wife Kathrine Spaanem, from\\r\\nUlvik in Hardanger, emigrated to America and went direct to Lodi. Ten\\r\\nyears later they moved to Springdale in Dane County.[368] In 1847 Peder\\r\\nFröland (see page 336) and Ole Jone, both from Hardanger, became the\\r\\nfounders of the Hardanger Settlement there. In 1846 Ammund Himle and\\r\\nfamily from Voss immigrated and settled near Lodi, but below the Dane\\r\\nCounty line.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [368] Peder Ödvin and wife returned to Norway in 1893 to spend\\r\\n        their declining days at Hardanger; Mrs. Ödvin died there\\r\\n        in 1895. In 1902 the son, L. P. Ödvin, visited his father\\r\\n        in Norway and brought him back to his home in Verona, Dane\\r\\n        County, where he died in 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the Spring Prairie Settlement in Columbia County, the\\r\\nnorthern extremity of which is more specifically called Bonnet Prairie,\\r\\ndates back to 1845. In that year four men settled about the same time\\r\\non Spring Prairie, namely: Odd Himle and Sjur S. Reque from Voss,\\r\\nAnders Langeteig from Vik in Sogn, and Knud Langeland from Racine\\r\\nCounty. The three first of these had families. Reque moved away again\\r\\nfour years later, settling on Liberty Prairie, not far from Deerfield.\\r\\nLangeland, as we have recited above, was already in 1848 back in Racine\\r\\nCounty as one of the founders of _Nordlyset_, the first Norwegian\\r\\nnewspaper published in this country; but Himle and Langeteig became\\r\\npermanent settlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book _Nordmaendene i Amerika_ Langeland gives a circumstantial\\r\\naccount of his coming to Spring Prairie. He says that in August of\\r\\n1845 he and Niels Torstensen, equipping themselves with a cook stove,\\r\\nprovisions, bedding, and all the necessities for camping out, drove\\r\\nwith oxen and a wagon from Racine via Koshkonong, following the regular\\r\\nroad to Madison (presumably going by West Koshkonong Church). But\\r\\nMadison did not attract them. He says: \"Madison had nothing remarkable\\r\\nabout it except its natural beauty and the big Territorial Building,\\r\\nwhich looked very imposing among the small frame houses.\" These sons\\r\\nof the land of mountains \"were scared away by the big hills\" where the\\r\\nUniversity is now situated, and turned east, driving almost as far\\r\\nas Fort Winnebago, where Amund Rosseland, a friend of Langeland\\'s,\\r\\nfrom Norway, had recently settled. Not finding the marshes here very\\r\\ninviting, and failing to meet Rosseland at home, they decided to turn\\r\\nback. Camping out over night, they drove back twenty miles the next\\r\\nday; then upon the advice of an American by the name of Young, they\\r\\nturned east, and driving on a few miles, came upon an American by the\\r\\nname of Gilbert, who was just engaged in erecting his log hut. The\\r\\nprairie here was to their liking and they selected a site and in due\\r\\ntime entered a claim on land.\\r\\n\\r\\nLangeland says there came no other Norwegians there that fall, but as\\r\\nwe have seen, three others did locate in other parts of the prairie,\\r\\nabout the time Langeland came there. That same fall Langeland went to\\r\\nMilwaukee to take out pre-emption papers and he stopped at Koshkonong,\\r\\nand told his countrymen there of the beauties of the prairies to the\\r\\nnorth, and a little later he wrote letters to friends in La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois. From Milwaukee he says he brought back to Spring\\r\\nPrairie with him a plow, a harrow, and other farm tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1846 Peder Fröland[369] came up there from La Salle\\r\\nCounty, bringing with him two ox-teams and a wagon and farm tools,\\r\\nbut he seems to have been the only one who came from La Salle County;\\r\\na number of settlers, however, came from Boone County and Jefferson\\r\\nPrairie to Spring and Bonnet Prairie in 1847-1850. In June, 1846,\\r\\nNorwegian immigrants began to come in hosts from or via Koshkonong,\\r\\nsays Langeland. He and Fröland plowed about one hundred acres of\\r\\nprairie land for the newcomers that season. Two years later Langeland\\r\\nsold his claim and moved back to Racine County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [369] Who had come to America in 1837.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it happened that also Spring Prairie became settled largely from\\r\\nKoshkonong, and as this was the period in which immigration from Sogn\\r\\nwas taking place on a large scale, it was especially Sognings who\\r\\ntook possession also of this region; though a considerable number of\\r\\nVossings also gradually moved in. Reverend L. S. J. Reque writes me\\r\\nthat Spring Prairie is today almost exclusively a Sogning-Vossing\\r\\nsettlement, and the former predominate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spring Prairie Settlement, whose beginnings have here been briefly\\r\\nsketched, rapidly expanded north to Bonnet Prairie, this part of it\\r\\ncoming to be known as the Bonnet Prairie Settlement. The settlement\\r\\nis located principally in Otsego Township, but partly in Hampdon and\\r\\nsurrounding towns. The first Norwegian settlers in this locality were\\r\\nJohn Anderson and Kjel Anderson, who came in 1846, having immigrated\\r\\nfrom Saude, Telemarken, that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of the founders of the settlement as submitted\\r\\nto me by Samuel Sampson of Rio, Wisconsin. Mr. Sampson (b. 1839) is the\\r\\nonly survivor of those who settled there at that time, being the son of\\r\\nThorbjörn Skutle. The year to the right of each name indicates the year\\r\\nof immigration to America. All except the last two settled at Bonnet\\r\\nPrairie in 1846; these two settled there in 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Name_                          _Wife_         _Where from_\\r\\n\\r\\n  John Anderson                     Anne           Saude       1844\\r\\n  Kjel Anderson                     Ingebor        Saude       1844\\r\\n  Hans Jörgensen Kjösvik            Kari           Holden      1847\\r\\n  Peter Halvorson Valöen            Kirsti         Holden      1846\\r\\n  Augon Aarness                     Ingeborg       Saude       1843\\r\\n  Leif Johnson Dahle                Liv Marie      Saude       1843\\r\\n  Tollef Olson Hawkos               Ingebor        Bö          1846\\r\\n  Iver Vangen                       Martha         Aurland     1844\\r\\n  Gunleik Olson Svalestuen          Ingebor        Saude       1844\\r\\n  Knut Gunnelson Tveten             Margit         Numedal     1844\\r\\n  Even Tostenson Indlæggen          Guro           Saude       1844\\r\\n  Hans Hawkos Aase                  Anna           Bö          1846\\r\\n  Hans Tollefson                    Helene         Saude       1846\\r\\n  Johannes Frondal                  Ragnild        Aurland     1845\\r\\n  Eilif Olson                       Johanne        Sogn        1845\\r\\n  Mikkel Knutson                                   Sogn        1845\\r\\n  Johannes Johanneson Gvaale        Kari           Saude       1845\\r\\n  Halvor Shelby                     Ingri          Saude       1848\\r\\n  Thorbjörn Sampson Skutle          Anna           Voss        1848\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the above was written I have received from Reverend L. S. J.\\r\\nReque of Morrisonville, Wisconsin, further facts relative to the\\r\\nearliest settlers there. The earliest records of the Bonnet Prairie\\r\\nChurch kept by Reverend A. C. Preus show that the testimonial of\\r\\nemigration was issued to \"Eivind T. Indlæggen.\" April 5, 1843, to\\r\\n\"Johannes Johannesen\" April 10th, 1843, to John Anderson and wife\\r\\nMay 3d and 6th, 1843, to \"Hans Olsen Haukaas\" May 7th, 1843. Also to\\r\\n\"Thorbjörn Samsonsen and wife Anna Ellingsdatter\" May 13th, 1844.\\r\\nAs it is probable that these emigrated at the time of issue of the\\r\\ntestimonial of emigration the table should be corrected with reference\\r\\nto these names. During the intervening three years most of the above\\r\\nhad lived in Boone County, Illinois, whither also some of the later\\r\\nsettlers came en route to Bonnet Prairie. Thorbjörn Skutle and family\\r\\nwho came from Voss, sailing on the ship _Hercules_, located first at\\r\\nJefferson Prairie. T. Skutle and his wife both died in 1897, age 88 and\\r\\n91 respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n            _Blue Mounds in Western Dane County, Wisconsin_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extensive Norwegian settlement in Western Dane County, ordinarily\\r\\nreferred to as Blue Mounds from the \"blue mounds\" in the township of\\r\\nthat name, was founded in 1846. Three families had, however, located\\r\\nthere as early as 1844, namely those of Thor Aase, Peder Dusterud,\\r\\nand Lars P. Dusterud. Thor Aase, with wife Martha, five sons and two\\r\\ndaughters,[370] settled on section ten in Springdale; they came from\\r\\nSogn in 1843 and had lived one year at Wiota. Peder Dusterud and wife\\r\\nand family settled on section 33 in Blue Mounds and the son Lars\\r\\nDusterud and wife located on section 27, both in Blue Mounds Township.\\r\\nThese two came from Rock Run, Illinois, where they had located in 1842,\\r\\nimmigrating from Vægli, Numedal.[371] They had also worked for some\\r\\ntime in the Dodgeville, Wis., lead mines.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [370] The children were Ivar (b. 1818), Lasse, Hermund, Talak,\\r\\n        John, Synneva, and Britha.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [371] Lars Dusterud and wife are still living at Mt. Horeb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846 a company of eleven persons arrived from Racine County; they\\r\\nwere the following: Tore Toreson Spaanem, Halvor and Nils H. Grasdalen,\\r\\nJohn I. Berge and wife Julia and one child, his sister Mrs. Knut\\r\\nSörenson Kvisterud, Tosten Thompson Rue, Ole T. Garden, Ole Kvisterud,\\r\\nand Ole Sjutvett. Knut S. Kvisterud, who had just before this gone to\\r\\nMineral Point and secured work there, came to Blue Mounds in 1848. John\\r\\nThompson later was more generally called \"Snow-shoe Thompson\" from the\\r\\nfact that he carried the U. S. mail over the Sierra Nevada Mountains\\r\\nfor twenty years (1856-1876), walking on _skis_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these came from Muskego, Wisconsin, whither they had immigrated\\r\\nfrom Tin, Telemarken. Spaanem and Halvor Grasdalen had come there in\\r\\n1841, Knut Kvisterud and wife in 1843, and Berge in 1845. The Rue\\r\\nfamily had come from Norway, as we have seen, in 1839 (see above page\\r\\n125). In 1846 the Town of Primrose, immediately south of Springdale,\\r\\nalso received its first Norwegian settlers, namely, Christian\\r\\nHendrickson, wife Maria and three children, Caroline, Henry, and\\r\\nCharles. He had emigrated from Lier, Norway, in 1842, and worked four\\r\\nyears in the lead mines at Wiota to pay his passage from Norway. Mr.\\r\\nHendrickson drove from Wiota to Primrose with oxen, all his possessions\\r\\nbeing then a wagon, a cow, and seventy-five cents. He lived eight years\\r\\nin the log hut first erected and built a stone structure in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next arrivals to Blue Mounds were Erik Solvi, who came from Sogn in\\r\\n1847, and lived successively in Springdale, Vermont, and Blue Mounds,\\r\\nand Gullik Svensrud and family from Vægli, Numedal, who had immigrated\\r\\nin 1844,[372] and first located on Rock Prairie. It was also in 1847\\r\\nthat the first immigrant from Valders arrived in Blue Mounds; this was\\r\\nRagnild Fadnes who in 1851 married Ever Halsten. She was born in North\\r\\nAurdal in 1826; as near as I am able to determine she was the only\\r\\nmember of the family who came at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [372] The party with which they came left Drammen April 20th and\\r\\n        landed at Quebec June 20th; they arrived at Rock Prairie on\\r\\n        July 4th. The family included several children; a daughter\\r\\n        Gunhild (b. 1837), married Halvor Halvorson of Mt. Horeb in\\r\\n        1856.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1846-1847 other localities, Wiota, Western Koshkonong, Spring\\r\\nPrairie and Norway Grove had claimed a considerable portion of the\\r\\nimmigrants. But in 1848 they began to come in in large numbers in\\r\\nthe townships of western Dane County and neighboring parts of Iowa\\r\\nCounty. To Primrose the following came in that year: Nils Skogen,\\r\\nSalve Jörgenson, and Nils Einarson. To Perry: Ole O. Bakken and wife\\r\\nAnne (Bergum) and two sons (Ole and Tideman) from Valders. This was\\r\\nthe first Norwegian family to locate permanently in Perry; Bakken\\r\\nbought the claim of a \"squatter\" named Andreas Olson, who was therefore\\r\\nthe earliest Norwegian in the township. Later in the same year came\\r\\nLars Langemyr from Christiania, Norway, Torger T. Tvedt from Aamli\\r\\nin Nedenæs, Reiar Aarhus from Telemarken, Halvor O. Milesten from\\r\\nHadeland, and Lars Halvorson and Hans Johnson from Drangedal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrivals of 1848 were Ole Barton, wife Ingeborg and son Ole,\\r\\nGulbrand Elseberg,[373] wife Ingeborg and two daughters, Christian O.\\r\\nSkogen, Ole O. Braaten and Nils O. Belgum; and in 1849: Knud Larson,\\r\\nAnders Lundene, Iver Halstein, Iver Lund, Ole Jelle, Sr., and Tore\\r\\nMaanem, all of whom were from Valders, mostly from North Aurdal.\\r\\nTollef S. Anmarksrud and wife Karen came to Koshkonong the latter\\r\\nyear, but he also removed to Blue Mounds in 1850. During the next few\\r\\nyears immigration to the various townships of western Dane County was\\r\\nrapid. For the fall of 1849 and in 1850 are to be mentioned, e. g.\\r\\nthe following arrivals in Springdale Township: Harald and Arne Hoff,\\r\\nOle and Aslak Lee, Levor Lien, Ole Thompson Brenden, Anders, John and\\r\\nKnut Lunde, Knut J. Lindelien, Harald Stugaard, Michel Kolskett and\\r\\nErik O. Skinrud; several of these had large families. To Blue Mounds\\r\\nTownship came: Erik Engen, Ole Boley, wife and four children, and Arne\\r\\nRöste, with family of eleven children; all those named here came from\\r\\nValders.[374]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [373] Elseberg not long afterwards started for Manitowoc to visit\\r\\n        a brother, who had just come there, and was never heard from\\r\\n        again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [374] Boley and Röste were from South Aurdal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Sogn came Ole A. Grinde and Ole Menes, the latter remaining,\\r\\nhowever, two years in Norway Grove before coming to Blue Mounds.\\r\\nMichael Johnson (b. 1832 in Leikanger, Norway) emigrated to America\\r\\nin 1853, located first in Windsor, then removed to Vienna, finally\\r\\nsettled permanently in Springdale in 1856. His parents, Jon Michelson\\r\\nDahlbotten and wife Randi, and his sister Martha[375] and younger\\r\\nbrother Botolf came to America in 1854. Mr. Johnson became a\\r\\nprosperous farmer and stock-raiser, his farm of 400 acres being one of\\r\\nthe finest in that part of the state. He took an active part in church\\r\\nand school affairs and was for many years a member of the governing\\r\\nbody (Kirkeraad) of the Norwegian Lutheran Evangelical Synod of\\r\\nAmerica. He held many positions of trust in the town and the county,\\r\\nwas a member of the State Legislature for three consecutive terms,\\r\\n1874-75-76, and for years a well-known figure in the politics of the\\r\\nstate. Mr. Johnson lived in Mt. Horeb since 1894; he died in 1908,\\r\\nleaving a widow and seven children.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [375] Martha married Ole O. Flom in 1854. Botolf is B. J. Borlaug,\\r\\n        well-known capitalist and banker of Kenyon, Minnesota. The\\r\\n        family had moved from Aurland to Borlang in Feios, Leikanger\\r\\n        Parish, where the children were all born.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Primrose and Perry the Norwegians also settled extensively in\\r\\n1849-1850. Among those who arrived in the former year were Gunnuf and\\r\\nOle Tollefsen from Sæltersdalen, who as we have seen above, page 281,\\r\\nhad immigrated to Muskego in 1845. Others who came to Primrose that\\r\\nyear were G. and Ole Danielson[376] from Telemarken, Leif Olson, Kittil\\r\\nMoland, Ole Anderson and Peter P. Haslerud. Tollefson relates how he\\r\\nbecame the possessor of his quarter section in Primrose as follows:[377]\\r\\n\\r\\n  As I wished to own land of my own as soon as possible, I went to\\r\\n  Primrose in 1849. Here I met Niels Einarson. There was enough\\r\\n  of land, but how to get the number of what I selected, was the\\r\\n  question. After much search we found a large oak a short distance\\r\\n  east from where Norman Randal lives. On this tree was clearly to be\\r\\n  seen the following letters and numbers: N. W. ¼, S. 23, T. 5, N.\\r\\n  R. 6 E. There was neither pen nor paper to get without going many\\r\\n  miles, and something had to be done at once. I borrowed an axe of\\r\\n  Emerson, cut down a little poplar, and, after having cut it flat on\\r\\n  both sides, so that it became quite thin, I took my pocket knife\\r\\n  and cut into it the letters and numbers just as they were in the\\r\\n  tree. With this poplar stuck under my arm I went to the land-office\\r\\n  and laid the stick and the money on the table, to the official\\'s\\r\\n  amusement. They understood the description and I got the land.[378]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [376] Ole Danielson had lived in Illinois since he came from Norway\\r\\n        in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [377] The citation is from Langeland, page 73.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [378] Tollefson says that at Clinton he worked for a Mr. Sherwood a\\r\\n        while; he cut 600 rails for the loan of the latter\\'s oxen and\\r\\n        wagon with which to bring his parents from Muskego to Rock\\r\\n        County.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1850 came Mrs. Ole Baker with son P. O. Baker (b. 1838), Mons\\r\\nNess, Elling Stamn, Ole Skuldt and Lars Halvorson from Hallingdal,\\r\\nKnut and Jens Olson from Stavanger, Lars L. Kolve and family from Voss\\r\\nand Knut Baardson (Bowerson) and family from Sætersdalen. During 1853\\r\\nto 1855 Norwegians came in still greater numbers, writes Reverend\\r\\nHöverstad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout twenty Norwegians settled in Perry in 1849; they were: Torger\\r\\nHastvedt, Hans J. Dahle, Ole Gangsei and Jacob Aanhus from Telemarken,\\r\\nAndreas Stutelien and Jul Haavernd, wife and eight children from\\r\\nValders, and Anders Sanderson from Hallingdal. After 1849 Norwegians\\r\\ncame in in large numbers, settling up the town rapidly.[379] I shall\\r\\nmention here only Onon Björnson Dahle (b. 1823) from Nissedal, who\\r\\nsettled in Perry in 1853, and Christian Evanson (b. 1819) from Valders,\\r\\nand wife Ragnild from Numedal, who came there in 1854.[380] Dr. Evans\\r\\ntells me that Ragnild Evanson (maiden name Ragnild Brekke) was born in\\r\\nNumedal, Norway, in 1819, and after her marriage to Christian Evanson,\\r\\nimmigrated to America in company with her brother Lars N. Brekke (who\\r\\nfor many years resided and conducted a grocery store in Madison, Wis.)\\r\\nin the year 1848, preceding her husband by about five years. They\\r\\ncame by sailing vessel, and were sixteen weeks on the voyage, having\\r\\nbeen grounded on a rock off the coast of England and were obliged to\\r\\nwait repairs. After landing in New York they came by Erie canal and\\r\\nthe lakes to Milwaukee, Wis., then to near Stoughton, Wis., and later\\r\\nto Madison, where she met her husband five years later. From Madison\\r\\nthey moved to Perry, Dane County, and settled on section twenty-three\\r\\nand remained there until their death.[381] O. B. Dahle, who had been\\r\\na school teacher in Nissedal, left Norway in company with a cousin,\\r\\nKnut Dahl, in 1848. They first came to Koshkonong, where the former\\r\\ntaught parochial school for two years. They went to California in 1850\\r\\nin search of gold as so many others. Having been unusually successful\\r\\nin the gold mines, they returned in 1853, and Onon Dahle bought a farm\\r\\nin Perry, on which he founded the village of Daleyville, beginning at\\r\\nthe same time there a mercantile business. Here he amassed a fortune,\\r\\nretired and moved to Mt. Horeb in 1897. In 1854 Dahle married Betsey\\r\\nNelson, daughter of Hermo N. Tufte of Racine County, and sister of\\r\\nthe well-known lay evangelist, Elling Eielson. Mr. Dahle always took\\r\\nan active interest in public affairs and in the work of the Lutheran\\r\\nChurch of which he is a member. He died in July, 1905, his wife having\\r\\ndied in February of the same year.[382]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [379] Among them were Knut Grimstvedt and Ole Hastvedt from\\r\\n        Telemarken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [380] Jens P. Tyvand (b. 1817) who had emigrated from Sannikedal\\r\\n        in 1843 to Lisbon, Ill., and removed to Stoughton, Wis., in\\r\\n        1847, settling in Pleasant Spring, located in Perry in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [381] Mrs. Evanson died in 1894 and Mr. Evanson in 1897, survived\\r\\n        by two children, Anne and Niels (Dr. N. E. Evans of Mt.\\r\\n        Horeb). C. Evanson was a successful farmer, owning 279 acres\\r\\n        of land; he also conducted a store at Perry after 1874.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [382] They left four children: H. B. Dahle, one time member of\\r\\n        Congress, J. T. Dahle (who died in 1908), Henry L. Dahle, all\\r\\n        of Mt. Horeb, and Mrs. James A. Peterson, Minneapolis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall close this chapter with a word about the first Norwegians\\r\\nin Madison, Wisconsin. It is not until 1850 that Norwegians began to\\r\\nlocate in Madison in considerable numbers. However, there were a few\\r\\nthere before that. As near as I can find out, Ole Torgeson, Ole O.\\r\\nFlom, Ole Lenvick, and Halvor N. Hauge, all of whom came to Madison in\\r\\n1844, were the first Norwegians in Madison. All four of these worked\\r\\nfor a printer by the name of Daniel Holt. Ole Flom, as we have seen,\\r\\nhad come from Norway with his parents that summer in the first party\\r\\nthat left Aurland, Sogn. He remained in Madison till 1847 when he\\r\\nreturned to his father\\'s farm at Door Creek.[383] Halvor Hauge had\\r\\ncome from Norway with his parents in the summer of 1844; the family\\r\\nhad located in the Town of Christiana. Halvor went to California in\\r\\n1848 where he remained several years, returning then to Koshkonong.\\r\\nOle Torgerson had emigrated from Norway in 1844, coming directly\\r\\nto Madison, where he continued to live till his death in 1900. He\\r\\npublished during 1850 there a Norwegian paper in the interests of the\\r\\nWhig party, but as this was not a paying enterprise he sold his types\\r\\nto Knut Langeland, who soon after began the issue of _Maanedstidende_\\r\\nin Janesville, having previously published _Nordlyset_ and _Demokraten_\\r\\nin Muskego. Among other Norwegians in Madison in the early days\\r\\nwere: Anne Vik, who worked for Dr. Collins during 1845;[384] in 1846\\r\\nshe married Halvor Bjoin, a Koshkonong pioneer. In July, 1846, Hans\\r\\nChristianson from Lærdal, Sogn, came to Madison; he, however, soon\\r\\nremoved to Blooming Grove, where he located permanently.[385] Halvor\\r\\nGabriel immigrated from Haugesund in 1848, coming direct to Madison,\\r\\nwhere he continued to live until 1877; he then moved to Sun Prairie and\\r\\nin 1893 to Fort Atkinson, where he died in 1897. Among the subscribers\\r\\nto _Nordlyset_ and _Demokraten_, 1848-1850, appear the names of three\\r\\nresidents of Madison, namely: Eric Anderson,[386] Lars Johnson, and\\r\\nWilliam Anderson. Finally, when the Bethel Congregation was organized\\r\\nin 1855 the following appear as charter members: Ole Torgerson, Mrs.\\r\\nOle Torgerson, Hans Olsen, Mr. Erickson, Olaf Olson, Haakon Larson,\\r\\nNels Peterson, Lars Nelson, Ole Lawrence, Halle Steensland, Eline Hoel,\\r\\nAnne Nilson, Ingeborg Olson and Anne Olson. Lars Nelson (Brekke) had\\r\\ncome there in 1848 from Numedal,[387] coming direct to Madison. Mr.\\r\\nNelson was well and favorably known as the owner of a grocery store on\\r\\nWest Main Street for many years. Of the other persons mentioned above\\r\\nonly Haakon Larson and Halle Steensland are now living. The latter has\\r\\nalways held a prominent place in the financial history of the capital\\r\\nand in general in the upbuilding of the city. He has always been a\\r\\nstaunch member of the Bethel Church, and was one of the leaders in the\\r\\norganization of the Norwegian-American Pioneer Association, of which he\\r\\nwas president in 1903-05.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [383] Flom was with Dr. Collins during 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [384] As we have seen, Knud Langeland and Niels Torstenson passed\\r\\n        through Madison in 1845.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [385] He died there a few years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [386] Erik Anderson had come to America with his parents in 1839\\r\\n        and lived in Chicago till 1845 (see p. 232). Then they moved\\r\\n        to McHenry County, Illinois. In 1847 Erik went to Muskego,\\r\\n        where he engaged as compositor in the office of _Nordlyset_,\\r\\n        setting the type for the first number. In 1848 he went to\\r\\n        Madison and began clerking in a general store. He settled as\\r\\n        a farmer in Winneshiek County, Iowa, in 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [387] See page 346 above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               CHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\n              _The Hardanger Settlement in Lee and De Kalb\\r\\n                Counties, Illinois. Big Grove in Kendall\\r\\n                       County and Nettle Creek in\\r\\n                       Grundy County, Illinois._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Hardanger has contributed a relatively small proportion of\\r\\nthe American immigrant population from Norway, several of the earliest\\r\\narrivals were from that province and its sons occupy today a prominent\\r\\nplace in Norwegian American history. It has been shown above, chapters\\r\\nIX and X, that several members of the party who came in 1836, as\\r\\nalso of that of 1837, were natives of Hardanger; and in the Chicago\\r\\ncolony in 1839 we met with several natives of that province. In 1839\\r\\na considerable number left Hardanger, especially from Ulvik Parish,\\r\\nas we learn from _Nordmandsforbundet_, 1909, page 175. Among these\\r\\nwere the brothers Anders and Johan Vik from Eidfjord in Hardanger. The\\r\\ntwo brothers first went to Wiota, where they secured work in the lead\\r\\nmines. In 1844 John Vik (Week) went to Dodgeville, where he established\\r\\nhimself as a shoemaker, entering into partnership with Johan Lee from\\r\\nNumedal. Later he went to Portage County, Wisconsin, where he prospered\\r\\nand was for over a decade a dominant power in the lumber trade of\\r\\nnorthern Wisconsin.[388]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [388] These facts gathered from an article by L. J. Erdall in\\r\\n        _Amerika_ for September 18, 1901. The brother, Anders Vik\\r\\n        (Andrew Week), went to California in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the immigrants who had come from Hardanger, Parish of Ullensvang,\\r\\nin 1836, we mentioned Ammund Helgeson Maakestad above, page 95.\\r\\nMaakestad dropped the family name in this country and called himself\\r\\nOmmon Hilleson. For a little over a year he was a coast sailor; then he\\r\\ndecided to go west and secure land where his countrymen had settled.\\r\\nThis he did, but not in the usual way, for Hilleson walked the whole\\r\\ndistance from New York to Chicago. This was in 1837.[389]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [389] As Reverend J. Nordby, Lee, Illinois, informs me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Chicago he directed his steps farther west; he did not, however,\\r\\ngo to the settlement founded several years before, but pushed on as far\\r\\nas Lee Center in the County of Lee.[390] Here he secured work, saved\\r\\nsome money, and bought a homestead in Bradford Township, and erected\\r\\nthereon a sod house. Soon after he married Catherine Reinhart, daughter\\r\\nof a German pioneer, recently moved in.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [390] Strand relates an experience which Hilleson had between Chicago\\r\\n        and Lee Center and which would seem to indicate that he had\\r\\n        intended to go to La Salle County.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten years Hilleson was the only Norwegian settler in the county,\\r\\nbut in 1847 there arrived in response to letters from Hilleson, a\\r\\nconsiderable party from Hardanger. These left Sörfjorden in Hardanger,\\r\\nand embarked in May at Bergen in the sailing vessel _Juno_, which\\r\\nbrought them to New York in a little over four weeks, a remarkable\\r\\nrecord for that time.[391] Mr. T. M. Newton (Torgels Knutson) says,\\r\\nwhen we came to Buffalo we met an old man who was returning to Norway.\\r\\nHe advised us to go back at once, saying America was not a fit place\\r\\nfor respectable people to live in, it was a place for thieves and\\r\\nrobbers. The party consisted of the following persons: Lars Larsen\\r\\nRöisetter (Risetter), Lars Olson Espe, Lars Helgeson Maakestad,\\r\\nGjertrud H. Lönning, Helge H. Maaketad (who died in 1854), Ingeborg\\r\\nH. Maakestad, Torgels Knudson Maakestad, Sjur Sjurson Bleie (Bly) and\\r\\nLars Larson Bly. They were met at Chicago by Ommon Hilleson; Lars Bly\\r\\nremained in Chicago, the rest started for Lee County, stopping a short\\r\\ntime at Norway, La Salle County, thereupon all but Ingeborg Maakestad\\r\\ndrove to Hilleson\\'s home in Lee County.[392] Most of them settled in\\r\\nBradford Township, but Lars Risetter (born 1827 in Ullensvang) bought\\r\\neighty acres of land in Sublette Township, whither other subsequent\\r\\nimmigrants from Hardanger also soon moved. Soon after arriving,\\r\\nRisetter and Gjertrud Lönning were married in the first house built by\\r\\na Norwegian in Lee County, at the home of Ommon Hilleson. Lars Espe and\\r\\nLars Risetter were the first two of the party to build a log cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [391] T. M. Newton says the journey took only three weeks; others\\r\\n        say, four. Newton was from Kinservig.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [392] The journey was made with oxen and lumber wagon. Inger Maakestad\\r\\n        remained at Norway for a time; she married Lars Espe soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Newton tells that two young men came from La Salle County about the\\r\\nsame time and bought a piece of land in Franklin Grove about two miles\\r\\nand a half from where he lived. \"They lived in a log cabin on their\\r\\nplace,\" he says. \"One night about two months after we arrived, they\\r\\nwere both murdered. The same day I had tried to persuade one of them to\\r\\nstay with me, but he felt it necessary to be at home. Their heads had\\r\\nbeen split open with an ax. I then thought of what the old gentleman\\r\\nhad tried to tell us and heartily wished myself back in Norway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the years 1848 no immigrants left Hardanger for America, and Lee\\r\\nCounty received no settlers directly from Norway. In 1849, however,\\r\\nthirty-two emigrated from Ulvik, but none of these seem to have come\\r\\nto the settlement. In 1850 there was one accession, namely, Amund\\r\\nLönning, who came directly to his brother-in-law, Lars Risetter, in\\r\\nSublette Township. He worked in the harvest the first season for Thomas\\r\\nFessenden for $11.00 a month, bought a quarter section in Willow Creek\\r\\nTownship in 1852, being the first Norwegian to settle there. In 1857\\r\\nLars Risetter also moved into Willow Creek Township, where he has since\\r\\nlived.[393]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [393] Mrs. Risetter died in 1897; Mr. Risetter is still living. His\\r\\n        two sons, Lewis and Holden, occupy the homestead with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the rest Torgels Maakestad, who adopted the name T. M. Newton\\r\\n(Knutson), is still living, his home being at Grinnell, Iowa. Sjur\\r\\nBleien lives at the Old People\\'s Home, Stoughton, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1851 the following arrived from Ullensvang, Hardanger, and located\\r\\nin the settlement: Jacob O. Rogde (b. 1828), Haaken L. Risetter and\\r\\nwife Maria (Hildal), Haldor Nilsen Hovland, and Agatha Espe, a sister\\r\\nof Lars Espe. Rogde purchased eighty acres of land in Bradford Township\\r\\nin 1854 and in 1855 he married Else Bly from Hardanger, who had come\\r\\nto America in 1854.[394] Haakon Risetter settled in Ogle County\\r\\nimmediately north of Lee County. Of those who arrived in subsequent\\r\\nyears many settled across the county line in De Kalb County, and in a\\r\\nfew years there had sprung up a thriving and prosperous community. At\\r\\npresent the Bradford Norwegian Evangelical Congregation of Lee numbers\\r\\n300 adult members. The center of the settlement is about four miles\\r\\nsouth of Franklin Grove.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [394] C. Christopher of Gruver, Iowa, who has kindly given me many\\r\\n        of the facts relative to the immigration from Hardanger,\\r\\n        names the following as arriving in Lee County in 1854; Lars\\r\\n        N. Rogde and wife Angar W. Sandvæn, Wigleik W. Risetter,\\r\\n        Helle P. Bly and wife Torbjör (Skare), Samson S. Sandvæn and\\r\\n        wife Bægga H. Maakestad. The last three and Lars Rogde died\\r\\n        the same year.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately east of De Kalb and the northern part of La Salle County\\r\\nlies Kendall County, into which extends a northeastern branch of the\\r\\noriginal Fox River Settlement, located chiefly in Big Grove Township;\\r\\nthe village of Newark lies within its boundaries. The first Norwegian\\r\\nto settle in the village of Newark was Ole Olson Hetletvedt, as we have\\r\\nobserved above. Ole Hetletvedt, or Medlepeint as he was called, was\\r\\nborn in August, 1797, and was, as we know, one of the members of the\\r\\nsloop party. Of his first years in this country we have already spoken.\\r\\nHe came to Newark in 1839; there he lived till his death in 1854. The\\r\\nnext settlers in Newark were Herman Osmonson and Knut W. Tysland, both\\r\\nof whom also located there in 1838.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegian settler at Lisbon was John Hill (Hidle) from\\r\\nFjeldberg in Söndhordland, Norway. He came to America in 1836,[395]\\r\\ngoing direct to La Salle County. Among the immigrants of that year\\r\\nwere also Anders Anderson Aasen and wife Olena and family from Tysvær\\r\\nParish, a little south of Haugesund. The family included a daughter\\r\\nSusanna, (born 1822), who was married to John Hill in 1844. The Aasen\\r\\nfamily lived in Kendall, New York, for two years, then in 1838 moved\\r\\nto La Salle County, Illinois. In 1839 John Hill located at Lisbon, and\\r\\nhe was thus the first Norwegian to settle here, whither a considerable\\r\\nnumber later moved.[396] About 1846 Sjur Larson came there from\\r\\nSkaanevik, Norway; Lars Chelley (Kjelle) came in 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [395] Lars Bö and Michael Bö came at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [396] John Hill died in 1892, but Mrs. Susanne Hill is still living\\r\\n        with her daughter, Mrs. Austin Osmond (b. 1845), in Morris,\\r\\n        Grundy County, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegians did not begin to come in extensively to Lisbon before\\r\\n1850. Mrs. Austin Osmond, oldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Hill,\\r\\nwho is now living in Morris, Grundy County, tells me that she was\\r\\nthe only Norwegian child in school at Lisbon when she first began\\r\\nto attend, but later there gradually came more. At Newark several\\r\\nNorwegians had already begun to move on. Goodman Halvorson (b. 1821)\\r\\nand wife Martha Grindheim from Etne Parish in Söndhordland, came to\\r\\nAmerica in 1847 and purchased land in Fox Township, Kendall County; he\\r\\nerected his log cabin there in the spring of 1848. Halvorson is still\\r\\nliving on the old homestead which, however, he leases to other parties.\\r\\nOsmund Tutland from Hjelmeland in Ryfylke, and wife Malinda from Aardal\\r\\nin Ryfylle and two children had come to Mission Township, La Salle\\r\\nCounty, in 1836; a daughter, Mrs. Anna Hegglund (b. 1842) is at present\\r\\nliving in Newark. Tutland became, in 1854, the founder of the Norwegian\\r\\ncolony at Norway, Benton County, Iowa.[397]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [397] Lars Fruland of Newark is a son of Nils Fröland, who emigrated\\r\\n        from Samnanger, near Bergen, in 1837, settling in La Salle\\r\\n        County.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the old pioneers of Lisbon was also Henry Munson from Voss, but\\r\\nI am not able to give the year of his arrival. Munson died in 1907,\\r\\nbeing over ninety years old. Wier Sjurson Weeks (born in Skaanevik in\\r\\n1812), and wife Synneva and two children emigrated in 1846; after much\\r\\nhardship, and sickness in the family, through which they lost the two\\r\\ndaughters, they arrived at Lisbon late in 1846. Here Weeks worked at\\r\\nfirst at the trade of a carpenter. In 1848 he bought eighty acres of\\r\\nland on North Prairie, five miles north of Lisbon.[398] Here he settled\\r\\npermanently, prospered, and became an influential citizen and active\\r\\nmember of the Lutheran Church of North Prairie. Mr. Weeks died in\\r\\nFebruary, 1900, at the age of eighty-seven; his wife lived till 1904,\\r\\nreaching the age of ninety-four. A name most closely associated with\\r\\nthe early annals of Newark is that of Torris Johnson (b. in Skaanevik\\r\\n1837), who came to America with his grandfather Torris Torison in\\r\\n1848.[399] Having arrived at Chicago, they went to Calumet, twenty\\r\\nmiles south of Chicago, to Halstein Torison, who was an uncle of Torris\\r\\nJohnson. There Johnson remained till 1851, when he located in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. Mr. Johnson served in the war, being promoted to sergeant;\\r\\nafter the war he returned to Newark. In 1865 he married Elizabeth\\r\\nRyerson, born in Stavanger, Norway; they have had six children. Mr.\\r\\nJohnson is still living, his home being in Newark.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [398] Mr. Strand has given a very complete sketch of W. S. Weeks to\\r\\n        which I am indebted for these facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [399] His parents died in Norway when he was a child; a brother and\\r\\n        sister also came to America at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough E. S. Holland (b. 1834) of Big Grove Township, did not settle\\r\\nin Kendall County before 1866, he belongs to the earlier pioneers now\\r\\nresident there, having come to this country with his parents in 1846.\\r\\nIn 1854 he settled in York Township, Green County, Wisconsin, where he\\r\\nmarried Johanne Chantland the following year. In 1866 they removed\\r\\nto Kendall County, Illinois.[400] Mr. Holland has been especially\\r\\nactive in the work of the church, and has been trustee and treasurer of\\r\\nPleasant View Luther College since its organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [400] Mrs. Holland died in 1884 and Mr. Holland married Christina\\r\\n        Peterson of Skien, Norway, in 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Nels O. Cassem occupies a prominent place in the history of\\r\\nthe settlement as of that of Kendall County in general. Born in 1829\\r\\nabout seven miles east of the city of Stavanger, Norway, he emigrated\\r\\nin 1849. Coming to Illinois he settled in Fox Township, Kendall County,\\r\\nin July of that year. Here he purchased land and began farming, an\\r\\noccupation which he prospered in to an unusual degree, his estate\\r\\nbeing estimated at a little over one million dollars upon his death in\\r\\n1904.[401] \"When he came to Illinois,\" writes his son, \"he found work\\r\\non the tow-path of the old Illinois and Michigan Canal, at fifty cents\\r\\nper day. During this time he formed the habit of saving, that was the\\r\\nunerring guide of all his future life.\" Randall Cassem defines the\\r\\nprincipal causes of his father\\'s success as:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Health; industrious habits formed in youth; the fact that money\\r\\n  came hard earned at first, thus teaching him the value of the\\r\\n  dollar; courage and self-reliance; knowing the value of little\\r\\n  things; the practice of self-denial and rigid economy; never\\r\\n  striving after extravagant profits in any of his undertakings. To\\r\\n  all of this we may add, his high sense of honor, his unimpeachable\\r\\n  integrity that, as those who knew him testify, never permitted him\\r\\n  to be other than absolutely fair and just in all his dealings and\\r\\n  financial transactions with others.\"[402]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who immigrated in 1844 and located in Chicago was also\\r\\nAnders K. Vetti from Vettigjæld, Norway. He lived in Chicago until\\r\\nabout 1849,[403] when he bought a farm at Yorkville Prairie in Kendall\\r\\nCounty. He married Anna Martha Ortzland in 1850 and lived there till\\r\\nhis death in 1875. Mr. Vetti was a man of strong character and unusual\\r\\nintellectual endowments. He wielded much influence politically in his\\r\\ncommunity, and enjoyed in a high degree the confidence of those who\\r\\nknew him. An obituary notice says of him: his truest and most enduring\\r\\nmonument will be the good resulting from his labor in the cause of\\r\\nuniversal education, in untiring opposition to the superstitious\\r\\nobservance of ceremonies incompatible with the spirit and the progress\\r\\nof the age, and in his hatred of all forms of political oppression.[404]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [401] Cassem married Margaret Fritz in 1851; she died in 1872.\\r\\n        There are five children: Randall Cassem, attorney at Aurora,\\r\\n        Ill.; Mrs. Olive J. Osmondson of Seward Township, Kendall\\r\\n        County; Oscar E. Cassem, Mitchell, South Dakota; Mrs.\\r\\n        Margaret Olson, Aurora, Illinois; and Mrs. Anna O. Rood,\\r\\n        Chicago, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [402] Kari Melhus of Newark, Illinois, who came to America about\\r\\n        1852, is said to be the oldest Norwegian woman in America.\\r\\n        She was born in Hjelmeland Parish, Ryfylke, in 1804.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [403] A. K. Vetti\\'s oldest daughter, Mrs. Samuel Mather (b. 1853)\\r\\n        of Springdale, Linn County, Iowa, says that it was in 1849,\\r\\n        or 1850 perhaps, but she is not certain which.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [404] The words \"universal education\" contain a reference to his\\r\\n        fight for the common schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few miles south of Lisbon, across the Grundy County line, a\\r\\nsettlement was founded in 1846. The county had been completely settled\\r\\nby Americans already, but Norwegians bought these out and gradually\\r\\nsupplanted them, exactly as they began doing a decade later at Saratoga\\r\\nin Grundy County, and have done still later in the city of Morris in\\r\\nthe same county. The settlement is located in Nettle Creek Township.\\r\\nThe first arrivals were Rasmus Scheldal, Ole Torstal, Paul Thompson,\\r\\nMichael Erickson, Simon Frye, John Wing, Lars Scheldal, Ben Hall, Ben\\r\\nThornton, John Peterson, G. E. Grundstad, William and Samuel Hage.\\r\\nSeveral of these men had families; they came mostly from Skaanevik; all\\r\\ncame between 1846 and 1848. In 1849 Halvord Rygh, Sr., and family of\\r\\nseven, and Sjur Nelson, wife, Jennie, and family, came from Norway and\\r\\nlocated there. Several of these men later moved away, as Paul Thompson,\\r\\nMichael Erickson, Rasmus Scheldal, and Ole Tvistal, who went to Story\\r\\nCounty, Iowa, while some members of the Rygh and Wing families went to\\r\\nGoodhue County, Minnesota, 1856. Sjur Haugen and family moved up to\\r\\nHelmar, Kendall County, in 1855.[405]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [405] The latter family included a son Nels (b. 1840), who is Nels\\r\\n        S. Nelson of Helmar, well known as a successful farmer and a\\r\\n        Republican leader in Kendall County.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this brief survey of the founding of these eastern extensions of\\r\\nthe Fox River Settlement, we shall leave Kendall and Grundy Counties.\\r\\nThe history of these settlements takes its beginnings at the very close\\r\\nof the period we are here considering. Their fuller discussion belongs\\r\\nto the history of the immigration of the following decade.[406]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [406] Individual settlers and single families had located in\\r\\n        various towns in northern Illinois during the later thirties\\r\\n        and forties. I shall name here Severt S. Helland and wife\\r\\n        Ingeborg who immigrated in 1836 and settled at Woodstock,\\r\\n        Illinois. Helland (b. 1828) came from Gjerdevig in Fjeldbjerg\\r\\n        Parish; his wife was born 1825 at Helland in Etne Parish.\\r\\n        They moved to Chicago in 1855 and in 1857 settled near\\r\\n        Slater, Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\n          _The First Norwegian Pioneers in Northeastern Iowa_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this chapter I shall give a brief account of the coming of\\r\\nNorwegians into northeastern Iowa and their founding of settlements\\r\\nthere between 1846 and 1851. We are near the close of the period which\\r\\nthis volume deals with. The founding of settlements in Iowa in 1849-50\\r\\nis but a part of a larger movement now beginning, which, in the course\\r\\nof a few years, resulted in the establishment of numerous settlements\\r\\nin Wisconsin, Iowa, and southeastern Minnesota.[407] These settlements\\r\\nwere founded in general through internal migration away from the older\\r\\nsettlements in Racine, Rock, and Dane Counties. The latter were now\\r\\nbecoming overcrowded and they furnished hundreds upon hundreds of\\r\\nrecruits to the new settlements that were fast springing up. It is with\\r\\nthe years 1848-49 that we associate this new trend in the movement,\\r\\nand which inaugurates this new period in the whole movement. Only its\\r\\nbeginnings will here briefly be sketched as related to the counties of\\r\\nnortheastern Iowa. Of the mass of material which has been placed at my\\r\\ndisposal, I can only select what appears most essential to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [407] And Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first county settled by Norwegians in northeastern Iowa was\\r\\nClayton. The first settlers were Ole H. Valle and wife and Ole T.\\r\\nKittelsland who located in Read Township in the summer of 1846. Both\\r\\nthese men had, however, entered Iowa three years before. In 1843\\r\\nthey had come to the old Fort Atkinson in Winneshiek County, and had\\r\\nremained there for three years in the service of the government.[408]\\r\\nValle and Kittelsland were both from Rollaug, Numedal; they had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1841 to Rock Prairie, and had from 1841-1843 worked in\\r\\nthe Dodgeville mines. In 1846 Sören O. Sörum from Land Parish, Norway,\\r\\ncame to Fort Atkinson and in 1847 Ingeborg Nilsen, a cousin of Ole\\r\\nValle, came there.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [408] Their duties being to show the Indians how to farm and in\\r\\n        general to teach them the white man\\'s ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1846 then, Valle and Kittelsland located in Clayton\\r\\nCounty,[409] buying a farm together, about three miles southeast of\\r\\nthe present village of St. Olaf.[410] Through letters from Valle the\\r\\nlocality was soon brought to the attention of Norwegian settlers in\\r\\nRock Prairie and Koshkonong. In the spring of 1849 Ole Herbrandson\\r\\nand family came out there from Koshkonong; he was an immigrant from\\r\\nMörkvold, Rollaug, in 1842 and had, it seems, visited Valle in Clayton\\r\\nCounty in 1848 and found the locality to his liking. In June[411]\\r\\nHalvor Nilsen Espeseth, Knut Hustad, Ole Sonde, and Ingbret Skarshaug,\\r\\ncame from Rock Prairie;[412] going to the western part of the county,\\r\\nNilsen selected land in Grand Meadow Township, becoming the founder\\r\\nof the Clermont extension of the settlement, which, as Norwegians\\r\\nbegan to come in gradually, expanded north into Fayette and Winneshiek\\r\\nCounties. Other arrivals of the same summer were Abraham Rustad\\r\\nand family, Bredo A. Holt, Jens A. Holt, all from Hadeland, Bertle\\r\\nOsuldson, Tallak Gunderson and family from Arendal, and Ole Hanson and\\r\\nfamily. These located in the Clermont region; Jens Holt on section\\r\\n17, Marion Township, and Hanson on section 6 in the same township.\\r\\nAbout simultaneous with these, Fingar Johnson, Helge Ramstad and wife,\\r\\nThorkel Eiteklep[413] Ole E. Sanden, with wife Guro and family, located\\r\\nin the eastern settlement.[414]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [409] The first white child born of Norwegian parents in the county\\r\\n        was Jorund Valle (Mrs. Lars Thovson, St. Olaf), daughter of\\r\\n        Ole Valle.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [410] See article by Rev. Jacob Tanner, entitled: \"En kort\\r\\n        Beretning 50 Aars kirkelight Arbeide; Clayton County, Iowa,\"\\r\\n        in _Lutheraneren_, 45 (1901). My facts here are gathered in\\r\\n        large part from this article.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [411] The date was June 11th according to _History of Clayton\\r\\n        County_, 1882, p. 831.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [412] The last three were from Hallingdal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [413] According to others these two did not arrive till 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [414] Tanner\\'s article. Sanden and Fingar Johnson settled in Wagner\\r\\n        Township.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founders of these settlements nearly all came from Rock Prairie,\\r\\nwhere they had lived the first few years after immigrating. During\\r\\nthe years 1850-1851 a large number of immigrants joined the colony.\\r\\nThe first of these were Lars Valle, Hellik Glaim,[415] and Austen\\r\\nBlækkestad, all from Numedal, Ole Engbrigtsen and Peter Helgeson from\\r\\nSigdal in Numedal, and Ole Gunbjörnson and Knut Jæger from Hallingdal,\\r\\nwhile Halstein Gröth and family from Næs in Hallingdal and Kittil Rue\\r\\nlocated in the western part of the settlement. The Gröth family located\\r\\nin Marion Township, where also James and Jacob Paulson Broby, who came\\r\\nfrom Hadeland the next year, settled. Mrs. Holger Peterson and son\\r\\n(Peter Holgerson) came in 1851 and settled in Wagner Township. Sören O.\\r\\nSörum and wife[416] settled in Farmersburg Township in 1850, being the\\r\\nfirst Norwegians there.[417]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [415] See above page 143.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [416] See note, on p. 213.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [417] In 1867 he moved to Wagner Township.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the very beginning of this period the movement was directed to\\r\\nthe counties to the North, Allamakee and Winneshiek. The immigration\\r\\nof Norwegians into Clayton County had practically ceased by 1855,\\r\\nthe chief reason for this probably being that the Germans came in\\r\\nvery large numbers, particularly to Clayton County, during the early\\r\\nfifties and soon occupied all the best land.[418] Northeastern Iowa\\r\\nwas but little settled, and the development of the wilderness had\\r\\nonly begun. Clayton County had in 1850 a population of three thousand\\r\\neight hundred and seventy-three, while Fayette had only eight hundred\\r\\nand twenty-five, and Allamakee seven hundred and seventy-seven. The\\r\\npopulation of Winneshiek County had reached four thousand nine hundred\\r\\nand fifty-seven.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [418] Rev. Tanner writes: \"When we look at this Norwegian\\r\\n        settlement as it was then and is to-day largely, it\\r\\n        immediately strikes us that it was wood and water the\\r\\n        colonists looked for, and therefore they let the prairie lie\\r\\n        and chose the hills along the Turkey River. Not until later\\r\\n        did they learn to understand the value of the prairie, but\\r\\n        then the Germans had taken most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAllamakee was the next county in order of settlement.[419] This county\\r\\nwas opened to settlement in 1848, but land was not put upon the market\\r\\nbefore 1850.[420] In 1849 Ole L. Rothnem, Ole O. Storlag, Ole K.\\r\\nGrimsgaard and Erik K. Barsgrind came from Rock County to Allamakee\\r\\nCounty and selected land. In 1850 they moved out with their families\\r\\nand in company with them came: Ole K. Stake, Arne K. Stake, Syver Wold\\r\\nand Thomas A. Grönna. Others who came about the same time were: Thomas\\r\\nAnderson[421] and wife Emilie, Sven E. Hesla,[421] Björn Hermundson,\\r\\nNils T. Rue, Östen Peterson, Lars Jeglum, Halvor E. Turkop, Ole S.\\r\\nLekvold, all from Hallingdal, and Nils N. Arnesgaard, who was from\\r\\nNumedal. Among others who followed the next year I shall mention: Knut\\r\\nKnutson,[422] G. H. Fagre and wife Katherine, and Ole Smeby (b. 1804),\\r\\nwife and sons Hans, Ole, and John. They settled on the prairie north\\r\\nof Paint Creek, living in their canvas-covered wagons until houses\\r\\nwere built. Those here named formed the nucleus of the Paint Creek\\r\\nSettlement, which already the next year received large accessions.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [419] The Fayette County settlement about Clermont is a western\\r\\n        extension of the second settlement in Clayton County; its\\r\\n        beginnings have been referred to above.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [420] The first entry of purchase appears under the date of October\\r\\n        7, 1850. The earliest settler in the county was Henry\\r\\n        Johnson, after whom Johnsonsport was named, but I do not know\\r\\n        of what nationality he was.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [421] Hesla had came to America in 1845, Anderson in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [422] Settled in Makee Township; he had came from Norway in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early settlers of Allamakee and neighboring counties experienced\\r\\nall the trials and hardships of pioneer life in an unsettled country.\\r\\nThere was no railroad nearer than Milwaukee. At McGregor there were\\r\\na few stores where the necessaries of life could be had.[423] The\\r\\nprocess of home building and the clearing of the forests was slow and\\r\\noften attended with many difficulties. The pioneers generally brought\\r\\nwith them no other wealth than stout hearts and strong hands, and it\\r\\nwas only by industry and severe economy that they were able to make a\\r\\nliving for themselves and their families. Those who hired out to others\\r\\nreceived very small wages, and as there was little money among the\\r\\npioneer farmers this was paid in large part in food or other articles.\\r\\nIt may serve as an illustration that in the winter of 1850-51 a pioneer\\r\\nin Clayton County[424] split seven thousand rails of wood for fifty\\r\\ncents a hundred; for this he was paid $3.50 in cash and the remainder\\r\\nin food.[425]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [423] In the Clermont Settlement there was a log-cabin store at the\\r\\n        village of Clermont.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [424] This pioneer is still living.--See Tanner\\'s article.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [425] A barrel of flour at that time cost twelve dollars in Iowa, and\\r\\n        a bushel of corn seventy five cents. The usual wages was 25c a\\r\\n        day, sometimes a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Norwegians who first settled in Allamakee County came from\\r\\nRock County, Wisconsin; later, some came from Dane County, Wisconsin,\\r\\nand also from Winneshiek County, where a settlement was formed in June,\\r\\n1850. Several, however, came from Norway by way of New Orleans and the\\r\\nMississippi, as did Gilbert C. Lyse in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1856 there were in the whole county five hundred and five\\r\\nNorwegians; one hundred and eighty-one of these had settled in Paint\\r\\nCreek (then Water-ville) Township, the rest being located mostly in\\r\\nthe neighboring towns of Center, La Fayette, Taylor, Jefferson and\\r\\nMakee. In the meantime a new settlement had been established in the\\r\\nnorthwestern part of the county, in Hanover and Waterloo, which soon\\r\\nextended into Winneshiek County. But the earliest Norwegian settlement\\r\\nin Winneshiek was formed on Washington Prairie in June, 1850,[426] when\\r\\na number of families moved in from Racine and Dane Counties, Wisconsin.\\r\\nEastern Winneshiek County received in the following year a large\\r\\nNorwegian population.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [426] The county was organized in 1850, and the first term of court\\r\\n        convened on October 5th, 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who came in the latter part of June, 1850, and settled on\\r\\nWashington Prairie were: Eric Anderson (Rudi),[427] the brothers Ole\\r\\nand Staale T. Haugen from Flekkefjord, Ole G. Jevne, Ole and Andrew\\r\\nA. Lomen, Knut A. Bakken, Anders Hauge, John J. Quale, and Halvor H.\\r\\nGroven, all from Valders, and Mikkel Omli from Telemarken. On July\\r\\nthird another party headed by Nels Johnson[428] arrived, including\\r\\nTollef Simonson Aae, Knud Opdahl, Jacob Abrahamson,[429] Iver P. Quale,\\r\\nGjermund Johnson (Kaasa),[430] and John Thun.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [427] See above page 232.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [428] The father of Martin N. Johnson, member of Congress from\\r\\n        North Dakota. Nelson Johnson was one of the founders of the\\r\\n        Muskego Settlement in Wisconsin in 1839. He later entered\\r\\n        the Methodist ministry and was for two years, 1855-1857,\\r\\n        pastor of the Norwegian M. E. Church in Cambridge, Wisconsin.\\r\\n        With the exception of these two years he lived in Winneshiek\\r\\n        County until his death in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [429] Father of Rev. Abraham Jacobson, to whom I am in part\\r\\n        indebted for facts on the early settlement of Washington\\r\\n        Prairie. Rev. Jacobson has also printed a pamphlet: _The\\r\\n        Pioneer Norwegians_, Decorah, 1905, 16 pages, which is a most\\r\\n        valuable contribution to the pioneer history of Winneshiek\\r\\n        County. A very brief chapter on the \"Pioneer Norwegians\" may\\r\\n        also be found in Alexander\\'s _History of Winneshiek County_,\\r\\n        1882, pages 185-186.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [430] A brother of Nels Johnson. Thun was from Valders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the coming of this party Reverend Jacobson has given the following\\r\\naccount: In the spring of 1850 his parents and a number of other\\r\\nfamilies left Muskego to move out west. The leader of the party\\r\\nwas Nels Johnson; he had a large military wagon drawn by six oxen.\\r\\n\"This had a big box on, filled with household goods and covered with\\r\\nwhite canvas. On the outside was placed, lengthwise, the wagon box,\\r\\nseveral joints of stove pipe, so the outfit, with a little stretch\\r\\nof imagination,\" says Rev. Jacobson, \"looked like a man-of-war; this\\r\\nwas the so-called \\'prairie-schooner.\\' Then there were other vehicles\\r\\nof all sizes and shapes, from truck wagons, the wheels of which were\\r\\nmade of solid sections of oak logs, down to the two-wheel carts.\" At\\r\\nKoshkonong, Dane County, so many more joined them that they were in\\r\\nall over one hundred individuals; the caravan included furthermore\\r\\nnow two hundred head of cattle, a few hogs and sheep, a mare and a\\r\\ncolt. They drove on via Madison, then a little village, to Prairie du\\r\\nChien, where the party divided one-half going to Vernon County,[431]\\r\\nWisconsin, the other half to Iowa. Reverend Jacobson says of the\\r\\njourney at this point:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Wisconsin river had to be crossed on a small ferry boat, the\\r\\n  propelling power was furnished by a horse placed on a tread-power\\r\\n  which worked the paddle-wheels. Only one wagon and a team at a\\r\\n  time could be taken aboard. The herd of loose cattle had to swim\\r\\n  over the river, all of which was accomplished without any accident\\r\\n  worthy of note. The ferry boat at Prairie du Chien was larger\\r\\n  and propelled by four mule power, but the water being high, the\\r\\n  Mississippi River was nearly two miles wide, and much time was\\r\\n  taken to get all to the western bank. Thirteen miles northwest from\\r\\n  McGregor at Poverty Point, since called Monona, another halt of a\\r\\n  creek was made. The scouting party before alluded to had visited\\r\\n  several localities, and opinions were divided as to which was the\\r\\n  best point to settle down. The company was now divided into three\\r\\n  divisions, we going with the original leader to the vicinity of\\r\\n  Decorah, landing on our claims on the third of July. The journey\\r\\n  had taken five weeks, counting from the time of starting. Those who\\r\\n  had room enough slept under the wagon covers, the others slept on\\r\\n  the bare ground under the wagons.[432]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [431] The Norwegian settlement at and about Westby, Vernon Co.,\\r\\n        dates from this time, 1850.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [432] Speaking of the Indians Rev. Jacobson says, \"They had their\\r\\n        homes in the Territory of Minnesota, and did not molest the\\r\\n        settlers in the least.\" On the banks of the Upper Iowa river\\r\\n        many Indian graves were found. The bodies were buried in a\\r\\n        sitting position, with the head sometimes above the ground. A\\r\\n        forked stick put up like a post at each end of the grave held\\r\\n        a ridge pole on which leaned thin boards, placed slanting\\r\\n        to each side of the grave. Thus each grave presented the\\r\\n        appearance of the gable of a small house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf this party Simonson, Opdahl, Abrahamson, and Quale settled in\\r\\nSpringfield, the rest in Decorah and Glenwood Townships.[433] Most of\\r\\nthe members of these parties had come to America several years before,\\r\\nas Opdahl in 1848 and Tostenson in 1847; three of them, as we know,\\r\\nRudi and the two Johnsons, had immigrated in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [433] The eastern two-thirds of Winneshiek County clear to the\\r\\n        Minnesota line in a few years became extensively settled by\\r\\n        Norwegians.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small party from Jefferson Prairie, Wisconsin, including Tore P.\\r\\nSkotland and his brother Endre P. Sandanger, Ellef and Lars Land,\\r\\nnatives of Ringerike, also came the same summer; these secured claims\\r\\naround Calmar. The first list of landed assessments in Winneshiek\\r\\nCounty[434] records the names of Jacob Abrahamson, Knud Guldbrandson\\r\\n(Opdahl), Ole Gullikson (Jevne), Egbert Guldbrandson (Saland), Erik\\r\\nClement (Skaali), Halvor Halvorson (Groven), O. A. Lomen, Ole Larsen\\r\\nBergan, Mikkel Omli, Tollef Simonson (Aae), T. Hulverson, and Ole\\r\\nTostenson.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [434] According to Reverend Jacobson, _The Pioneer Norwegian_ p. 5;\\r\\n        the list is for 1852.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other settlers of 1850, not named above, I may name: Nils\\r\\nThronson, who had come from Valders in 1848, settling in Dane County,\\r\\nWisconsin he located in Glenwood Township in the summer of 1850;\\r\\nChristopher A. Estrem from Vang Parish, who had immigrated to Chicago\\r\\nin 1848; he came to Winneshiek County and located in Frankville\\r\\nTownship as one of the very first Norwegians there; Engebret Haugen,\\r\\nwho had immigrated in 1842, locating near Beloit, Wisconsin; the family\\r\\nsettled near Decorah in 1850, purchasing the old Indian Trading Post\\r\\nthen owned by J. G. Rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1850 Johannes Evenson, Ole L. Bergan, Knud L. Bergan,\\r\\nand Jörgen Lommen came. Of these Evenson located west of Decorah, in\\r\\nMadison Township, becoming the first Norwegian to settle there.[435]\\r\\nAs near as I can tell, Lars Iverson Medaas and family were the first\\r\\nNorwegians to settle in Canoe Township. Iverson who was born at\\r\\nTillung, Voss (in 1802), but had married Sigrid Vikingsdatter in\\r\\nGraven, Hardanger (1835) and settled on the farm Medaas, emigrated to\\r\\nAmerica in 1850. They spent the first winter on Liberty Prairie, Dane\\r\\nCounty, Wisconsin, and moved to Winneshiek County early in the spring\\r\\nof 1851, locating in Canoe Township, on section two, where they lived\\r\\ntill their death.[436]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [435] Helge N. Myrand and his widowed mother, who had immigrated in\\r\\n        1841 and settled in Muskego County, came west and located in\\r\\n        Madison in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [436] Iverson died in 1887, his wife in 1890. Iver Larson, well\\r\\n        known merchant and for many years treasurer of the United\\r\\n        Norwegian Lutheran Church, who died in 1907, was a son of\\r\\n        Iverson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Norwegians to enter Hesper Township were a party of\\r\\nimmigrants who came by the ship _Valhalla_ from Tönsberg in the summer\\r\\nof 1852. They were from Tolgen, in northern Österdalen, and from Röraas\\r\\nand Guldalen,[437] hence from a much more northerly region than their\\r\\ncountrymen in southern Winneshiek County. The party consisted of the\\r\\nfollowing: Trond Laugen, John Losen, Sr., Bendt Pederson, Ingbrigt\\r\\nBergh, Mons Monsen, all of whom were married, and John Vold and Jocum\\r\\nNelson. These were followed in the next year by John S. Losen, Jr., and\\r\\nOle B. Anderson Borren. Among the earliest settlers from other regions\\r\\nwere Paul Thorsen, Salve Olson and Torjus Gunderson from Sætersdalen,\\r\\nKnut Herbrandson and Christian Lien from Hallingdal, Aadne Glaamene and\\r\\nfamily from Voss, Lars Bakka and Bendik Larson from Sogn, and Peder\\r\\nWennes from Vardalen.[438]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [437] They were the first emigrants to America from this district.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [438] For the facts on Hesper Township I am indebted to Mr. J. A.\\r\\n        Nelson of Prosper, Minnesota, a student in the State University\\r\\n        of Iowa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the towns of Springfield, Decorah, and Glenwood, the settlement\\r\\nthus soon spread into the neighboring townships--north into Canoe,\\r\\nHesper, and Highland, where it united with the settlement in\\r\\nnorthwestern Allamakee County, and south through the towns of Calmar\\r\\nand Military, uniting with the settlement in north central Fayette\\r\\nCounty in Door Township. This last settlement extends through Pleasant\\r\\nValley southward into Clayton County. Together these settlements form\\r\\nthe eastern part of Clayton County, west through Fayette, and north\\r\\nthrough Winneshiek to northern Allamakee. In Allamakee it extends as\\r\\nfar as Harper\\'s Ferry and Lansing. The bulk of the population, however,\\r\\nis found in Winneshiek County. The principal Norwegian townships are:\\r\\nGlenwood, Decorah, Springfield, Madison, and Highland. About half of\\r\\nthe population of the county is of Norwegian birth, or of that descent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              CHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\n      _Survey of Immigration from Norway to America. Conclusion._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are then at the end of our task. We discussed at first early\\r\\nindividual immigration from Norway down to the year 1825. Then tracing\\r\\nbriefly the fortunes of the party of immigrants who came from Norway\\r\\nthat year we followed the subsequent immigration, year by year,\\r\\ndown to 1848, and the founding of settlements in this country from\\r\\nOrleans County, New York, in 1825, to Winneshiek County, Iowa, in\\r\\n1850. The growth of the emigration movement in Norway and the course\\r\\nof settlements here have been indicated. The names of the promoters\\r\\nof emigration in each district and province and of the founders of\\r\\nsettlements have in all cases been given. In most cases we have\\r\\nsucceeded in giving a fairly complete list of names of the settlers\\r\\nin any community during the first four to eight years of its history,\\r\\nthat is its period of growth, the years during which it assumed the\\r\\ncharacter of a Norwegian settlement. The varied causes of emigration\\r\\nwere also discussed at some length as also other questions as the\\r\\ncost of passage and duration and course of the journey; and in the\\r\\ndiscussion of the individual settlements we have now and then given\\r\\na glimpse of the general conditions of life in early pioneer days.\\r\\nI desire now by way of conclusion to summarize briefly the course of\\r\\nemigration in Norway and the distribution of the representatives of\\r\\neach district in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first emigrants from Norway were from Stavanger, Haugesund and\\r\\nRyfylke. Before 1836 the movement did not reach out beyond these\\r\\ndistricts although a few individuals had come from Söndhordland and\\r\\nHardanger. The emigration from Hardanger begins properly in 1836;\\r\\nthat year also records the first arrivals from Voss.[439] However\\r\\nmost of the immigrants of that year, as the following two years, were\\r\\nfrom the districts that had furnished the emigrants of the decade\\r\\n1825-1835. The year 1837 is especially noteworthy for the sailing of\\r\\nthe first emigrant ship from Bergen and that the immediate vicinity\\r\\nof Bergen for the first time furnished its quota of the emigration.\\r\\nIt is further significant in that Voss now enters definitely into the\\r\\nmovement, and that Upper Telemarken and the neighboring region of West\\r\\nNumedal contributed the first recruits to the American settlements.\\r\\nThe emigrants of 1839 came in considerable part from Upper Telemarken,\\r\\nfrom Numedal, from Voss and Hardanger, but not a few also from the\\r\\nolder districts. This continued in 1840 and 1841, except that there\\r\\nwere no emigrants from Hardanger during these two years and very few\\r\\nfor the next four years also. In 1842 the first party left Sogn and in\\r\\n1844 and 1845 considerable numbers came to America from this district.\\r\\nThe year 1843 is especially noteworthy for the very large emigration\\r\\nof that year from Upper Telemarken and the growth of the movement in\\r\\nnew parishes in Numedal. In this year also the America-fever enters\\r\\nLower Telemarken, a number of families going to America from Holden\\r\\nParish and Kragerö, which in 1844-1845 expands to include Sande and Bö\\r\\nand the region of Skien. During 1843 the first emigrants also leave\\r\\nSætersdalen, and from now on it is to be observed that there is a\\r\\nsteady out-going of emigrants from Ryfylke and Söndhordland for the\\r\\nperiod of nearly a decade. The movement is also beginning to expand\\r\\nin two other directions; north from Numedal into Hallingdal and soon\\r\\nafter northeast from the region of the Sognefjord up to northern and\\r\\nthe extreme Inner Sogn. The influx of immigrants from Telemarken and\\r\\nNumedal continues, and in increased numbers from Voss and the movement\\r\\nbegins anew in Hardanger in 1846. Hallingdal sent forth a large number\\r\\nof families and single persons in 1846-47, most of whom as we know\\r\\nsettled in Rock and La Fayette Counties, Wisconsin, many later moving\\r\\ninto Iowa. In 1847-48 these two movements meet in Valders, the one from\\r\\nHallingdal entering first in South and North Aurdal, the other from\\r\\nLærdal and Aardal in Sogn, entering about 1850 into Vang, Hurum and\\r\\nWest Slidre in Valders. In the meantime the movement has traveled also\\r\\nfrom Lower Telemarken, Drammen and Eastern Numedal (Sigdal) up through\\r\\nRingerike, Hadeland and Land. Especially large was the emigration\\r\\nfrom North and South Land clear to Torpen in 1847-1850. The region\\r\\neast of Land, i. e., Toten, Hedemarken and Solör furnish occasional\\r\\nimmigrants from now on but not in considerable numbers until many years\\r\\nlater. From Land and from Valders the movement grows northward into\\r\\nGudbrandsdalen and northwestward into Österdalen and Trondhjem, from\\r\\nwhich provinces, however, relatively very few emigrated to America\\r\\nuntil after 1850, and the emigration was not heavy from this region or\\r\\nfrom the northern coast districts,--Söndfjord, Nordfjord, Söndmöre,\\r\\nNordmöre--until after the Civil War.[440]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [439] At least eighteen persons from Hardanger and two from Voss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [440] And from Nordland not until after 1875. It is to be observed\\r\\n        also that the emigration from the older inland districts was\\r\\n        very heavy clear down to 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the number of immigrants that each of the districts had\\r\\ncontributed to the American population before 1850, or have down to the\\r\\npresent time, it would be difficult to say. The emigration from such\\r\\nvast districts as Telemarken and Sogn, as later from Gudbrandsdalen,\\r\\nHedemarken and Österdalen, has been heaviest, while from Ryfylke and\\r\\nVoss the incoming settlers have been very numerous, as also from the\\r\\nsmall but very populous Söndhordland, Hadeland and Land. Valdris and\\r\\nHallingdal[441] each about half as large as Sogn have contributed\\r\\nperhaps each about one-third as many immigrants as Sogn, each\\r\\ncontributing about equally to the American emigration. Relatively\\r\\nsmall has been the immigration from Hardanger, Sætersdalen and the\\r\\nvicinity of Stavanger. The extensive districts of Telemarken and Sogn\\r\\nentered early into the movement and have continued down to the present\\r\\ntime to furnish large numbers of recruits to the Norwegian immigrant\\r\\npopulation. Representatives of these two regions, the immigrated and\\r\\ntheir descendants, are, I believe, most numerous among the various\\r\\ngroups of Norwegian settlers in America.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [441] In 1891 Hallingdal had a population of 12,900, Valdris 17,000,\\r\\n        Sogn 37,050, Söndhordland 34,750, Hardanger 25,900, Ryfylke\\r\\n        46,000, Telemarken 44,000, Sætersdalen 8,380. The population\\r\\n        of each is much larger now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this country the relative position of the representatives of each\\r\\nis about that which they occupied in the old; this finds its reason\\r\\nchiefly in the time at which the different states were opened up to\\r\\nsettlers. Natives from Stavanger, Ryfylke and Söndhordland are found\\r\\nchiefly in Illinois and in the settlements of Central Iowa (Benton\\r\\nand Story Counties). In Illinois are located also in large numbers\\r\\nnatives of Hardanger (Lee County), and Voss (Chicago), but only to a\\r\\nvery limited extent those of other districts. In Southern Wisconsin\\r\\nand to a slight extent in the adjacent parts of Illinois have located\\r\\nespecially the natives of Numedal, and to some extent those of Land\\r\\nand Sogn. Natives of Sogn have, however, found homes most extensively\\r\\nin the various settlements of Wisconsin and Minnesota and Northern\\r\\nIowa.[442] Here they are present in all parts of the states but in\\r\\nlargest numbers in the oldest settlements in Southern and Western\\r\\nWisconsin and in Southeastern Minnesota. Natives of Telemarken are\\r\\nfound well scattered, from their original center in Racine County,\\r\\nthrough Walworth and Dane Counties, thence to Central Wisconsin and\\r\\nMinnesota. The representatives of Valders are found in largest numbers\\r\\nin Western Dane County, in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, and in Goodhue\\r\\nCounty, Minnesota.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [442] In Winneshiek and Worth Counties, where also natives of\\r\\n        Hallingdal have settled in large numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will not be possible to discuss here the later development of the\\r\\nvarious settlements that have been treated above or the increase of the\\r\\nNorwegian factor in the counties where these settlements were formed.\\r\\nSpace forbids this, and these facts have, furthermore, been briefly\\r\\nindicated elsewhere in this volume. Thus in Chapter II we have outlined\\r\\nthe extent of immigration from Norway and the geographical distribution\\r\\nof settlements, while the subsequent history of the special settlements\\r\\nhas often been briefly indicated. It may here be added that the\\r\\ncounties in Southern Wisconsin as a whole enjoyed a much more rapid\\r\\ndevelopment during the years 1840-1850 than those of Northern Illinois,\\r\\nand that this was due in a very large measure to the incoming of such\\r\\na large number of settlers from Norway[443] in the best years of their\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [443] Similarly the \"Norwegian\" county of La Salle in Illinois\\r\\n        was the leading county in that part of Illinois in the same\\r\\n        period, its population in 1850 being 17,815, that of Grundy\\r\\n        3,023, and De Kalb, 7,540.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1900 the principal Norwegian counties among those that fall\\r\\nwithin the scope of the discussion in this volume were in order: Cook\\r\\nCounty, Illinois; Dane County, Wisconsin; Winneshiek County, Iowa;\\r\\nMilwaukee County, Wisconsin; Rock County, Wisconsin; and La Salle\\r\\nCounty, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has elsewhere in this volume been shown that Wisconsin early became\\r\\nthe objective point of immigrants from Norway. This significant\\r\\nposition in Norwegian-American history Wisconsin continued to hold\\r\\nthroughout the whole period we have discussed and for a long time\\r\\nafterwards. In 1850, fifty per cent of all Norwegians in the United\\r\\nStates were domiciled within the borders of the State of Wisconsin. It\\r\\nwas with Wisconsin that the chief events in early Norwegian-American\\r\\nhistory are associated. The principal scenes in the great pioneer drama\\r\\nwere enacted here. As all the paths of the Norwegian immigrant in that\\r\\nearly day led to Wisconsin so the threads of all subsequent Norwegian\\r\\nhistory in America lead back to Wisconsin.[444] Whether in material\\r\\nwelfare, in church, in politics or in education it was in Wisconsin\\r\\nthat the Norwegian first made a place for himself in America and laid\\r\\nthe foundation for all his later progress.[445]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [444] Barring the relatively very small Norwegian factor in the\\r\\n        cities of the East, which stands practically isolated from\\r\\n        Norwegian American life.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [445] At the same time we must not forget that the era of\\r\\n        settlement began in Illinois, and Illinois has always\\r\\n        continued to hold a prominent place in Norwegian-American\\r\\n        history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               Appendices\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               APPENDIX I\\r\\n\\r\\n

The subject died in 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several footnotes which are referred to more than once (47\\r\\nand 85). These may be errors, but are retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 313, the words \"at the homestead near West Koshkonong\" are\\r\\nrepeated and have been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 269, the reference to footnote 277 was misprinted as \"227\", and\\r\\nhas been corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 319, the references to notes 347-349 appear out of order,\\r\\nfollowing, rather than preceding, notes 350 and 351 on p. 318. The\\r\\nnumbering has been retained, though the footnotes, all moved to the end\\r\\nof the Registry covered by these pages, appear in numerical order.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn p. 322, the reference to footnote 356 is missing from the text, but\\r\\nperhaps belongs to the entry for \"Ole (Leirdal)\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe index has a number of editorial issues. Minor inconsistencies of\\r\\npunctuation are corrected without mention here. There are number of\\r\\nentries which lack page references. Some can be found in the text, and\\r\\nare provided in the list below.

Johnson\", for which there\\r\\nis no page number, and no obvious mention in the text under either name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surname \"Sane\" in the index is an error and refers to the name\\r\\n\"Saue\". It has been corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nProper names are sometimes inconsistent, especially between the text\\r\\nand footnotes. The ae ligature is variously spelled \\'ae\\' or \\'ei\\'.\\r\\nUnless there are many instances of a given spelling, both are retained\\r\\n(e.g., \"Spelleman\" vs. \"Spellemand\"). The letter ö sometimes is printed\\r\\nwithout the diaeresis as \\'o\\'. Where the preponderance of instances\\r\\nof a given name are correct, the offender has been corrected. In the\\r\\nRegistry in Chapter XXXVII, the surnames for Peder Amund Egdetvedt and\\r\\nColbein Torkildsen Edgetvedt differ.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\r\\nof Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

If you received the work electronically, the person\\r\\nor entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second\\r\\nopportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If\\r\\nthe second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing\\r\\nwithout further opportunities to fix the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.F.4.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
