There is a hip red scare in Russia\\nwhich is scaring the wits out of the plundering\\ncapitalists of the world.\\nThere is a red scare in Germany. It hangs like\\na Damocles sword over the necks of the frightened\\nTeutonic bourgeoisie.\\nThere is a sizable red scare in China. The cap\\nitalist pirates are scampering around in all direc\\ntions wondering what has hit them.\\nThere are red scares in Italy, Bulgaria, Spain\\nand in other countries. In other words, the po\\nlitical power of capitalism in those countries hangs\\nby a slender thread and the proletariat is develop\\ning the will to power.\\nHere in America the capitalists are yet strong\\nand the great masses of workers are suffering from\\nthe illusion that their problems can be solved by\\nreforming capitalism and rather than take on the\\njob of solving their own problems by giving the\\ncapitalists the tip of the proletarian boot, they\\nrely on fossilized political jockeys like LaFollette\\nto dope them with promises.\\nBut even in the United States the red nightmare\\nhaunts the couch of the capitalist class. While\\nthey are yet strong they know that the onward\\nmarch of the world revolution will not skip Amer\\nica. Tho the masses in this country are now in\\ndulging in a political debauch as the paying guests\\nof LaFollette, our rulers know that the morning\\nafter will bring cooler heads aud the conditions\\nof life will force the workers to turn to Comrnun\\nism as their only salvation.\\nTherefore we have periodical “red scares.\" It\\nis true that the so-called exposures are ninety-nine\\nper cest lies. But that there is a market for the\\nwares of the stoolpigeons shows how deep is the\\ncapitalist dread of the inevitable awakening of the\\nlabor giant.\\nThus Jakey Spolansky, unemployed government\\nlink, can get good American dollars for a series\\nof imaginary tales about the “Red Terror” in the\\nChicago Daily News. If the editor of the News\\nis satisfied, the feeling shoflld\\'be unanimous. No\\ndoubt Jakey got the money—it is safer than work\\ning as a prohibition agent and holding up sacra\\nmental wine stores with the possibility of detec\\ntion and a jail sentence. The Communists are not\\nbothered seriously —it gives them publicity of a\\nsort. It calls attention to them and The DAILY\\nWORKER is here to give the right kind of pub\\nlicity.\\nLife being such as is it, a good “red scare”\\nserved up by an artistic liar would make better\\nreading than one of the Calvin Coolidge’s speeches.\\nBut Spolansky is a great disappointment. His\\nstuff is very stale.\\nThe Supreme Court Once More\\nThe United States supreme court is back on the\\njob. No sooner does it get back on the job than it\\nstrikes a blow at the workers of the whole country.\\nThis time it is the railway workers that have\\nbeen singled out for the assault by the highest\\noracle of the employing class. The holy synod of\\ncapitalist bishops has decided to uphold the con\\nviction of workingmen formerly employed on the\\nSanta Fe railroad and charged with conspiracy\\nto obstruct the mails and interference with in\\nterstate commerce. The case grew out of the shop\\nmen’s strike in 1922 and the difficulties arising in\\nthis dispute on the California Arizona border.\\nTwo years after a struggle waged by the work\\ningmen in behalf of their right to organize and\\nagainst unspeakable conditions of employment the\\nsupreme court finds it necessary to punish rail\\nway men. There is only one crime the workingmen\\nare guilty of in the eyes of the supreme court. It\\nis a crime against the bosses. In the eyes of the\\ncapitalist judges the worst crime that can be com\\nmitted is the lighting against exploitation.\\nEveryone knows that the charges against the\\nrailway men were unfounded. Everyone knows\\nthat, the Santa Fe workers were especially singled\\nout for assault during the shopmen’s strike lie\\ncause of the heroic struggle they put up against\\noverwhelming odds. Everyone knows that the out\\nrages attributed to the Santa Fe workers were\\nperpetrated by the gunmen and detectives hired\\nby the corporation in order to secure a legal pre\\ntense for a vicious assault by the government\\nagainst the strikers. We recall the tale of marooned\\npassengers suffering in the desert. We recall that\\neven the hard-boiled Hauta Fe was compelled to\\nrepudiate many of these faudulent stories.\\nThe Manta Fe decision comes at a time when\\nthe workers are called upon to vote another In\\ndcmraent of the whole capitalisl system and its\\njudicial oligarchy. Mr. John W. Davis now asking\\ntlie work.,;., tv f\\'*r him as the democratic presi\\nlential candidate was. until the election campaign,\\nme of the stockholders of this strikebreaking road.\\nAs soon as he is ignominiously defeated in the\\nelection contest he will go back to this director\\nship. Among the owners, of the Santa Fe are many\\nfinanciers and industrialists who are today back\\ning the Coolidge campaign.\\nThe supreme court is the chief defender of the\\nemploying class in the United States. When the\\nsupreme court speaks it speaks for the ruling class\\nas a whole. This attack on the workers ought to\\nbe answered by the working class as a whole.\\nGompers Prepares for “Victory”\\nSamuel Gompers is preparing for “victory” at\\nthe polls. Mr. Gompers is preparing for a victory\\nfor his policy of non-partisan political action, for\\nhis policy of “reward your friends and punish your\\nenemies.”\\nMr. Gompers has announced that he expects the\\nelection of at least 250 “friends” of labor to be\\nchosen as congressmen in the November elections.\\nIn the last elections Mr. Gompers boasts of having\\nsent to the house of representatives 170 “friends.”\\nThis year the outlook for such “success” is much\\nbetter. Consequently Mr. Gompers is certain that\\nhe will be right in his prophecies.\\nGranting the accuracy of Mr. Gompers as a\\nprophet and political seer, one fails to see where\\nthe workers and poor farmers of this country will\\nbe in a position to claim a victory or have cause\\nfor jubilation, The men who will be elected as\\nchampions of the workers will not be representa\\ntives of the workers, but republicans and democrats\\nwho happened to have received the indorsement of\\ncertain officials of the trade union movement. They\\nwill not be elected as spokesmen of the workers\\nand poor farmers but as so-called good men, honest\\nmen who are at the same time regular republicans\\nand hundred per cent democrats.\\nIn the last congress there were 170 such worthies\\nwho received the indorsement of Mr. Gompers.\\nThis is an auspicious number. If this were a\\ncriterion of the conscious political strength of the\\nworking masses it would certainly indicate con\\nsiderable progress by our working class towards\\nindependent class political action along national\\nlines. But it is nothing of the sort. These self\\nstyled friends of labor were pliant tools of the big\\nbusiness interests of the country. The best proof\\nof their not being defenders of the workingmen is\\nto be found in the record of this congregation of\\nfraudulent friends.\\nThe last congressional in which there\\nwere so many Gompers “friends” of laboV did noth\\ning in the way of enacting measures to enhance\\nthe welfare and interests of the working masses.\\nThe vicious railway labor board, the Esch-Cum\\nmins Act, agricultural relief, and many other\\npressing problems confronting the workers and\\npoor farmers were deliberately evaded by the last\\nsession. In short the Gompers “friends” of labor\\nhave been everything but spokesmen for and de\\nfenders of the interests of the workers.\\nThe “victory” Mr. Gompers is preparing to\\ncelebrate is no victory for the working class. 1 ■\\nThe Reward of Ability\\nOne of the loudest wails raised by the defenders\\nof capitalism when the sanctity of the profit sys\\ntem is challenged, is over the integrity of indi\\nvidual incentive. The spokesmen for the ruling\\nclass would have us believe that once the means\\nof production and exchange socially used are so\\ncially owned and controlled, that once the private\\nownership for profits is abolished there will be an\\nend to the incentive of the individual for achieve\\nment. ,\\nThese champions of the capitalist system as a\\nrule tend to cite the case of the inventor or the\\nscientist. They would have the world believe that\\nunder a Communist system of society these men\\nwould be denied the fruits of their labor. This\\ncontention is based on a wholly gratuitous as\\nsumption. There is nothing further from the truth\\nthan the notion being spread that individual\\nability is the basis of capitalist reward. AVe have\\na particular case in mind. This case is typical of\\nthe countless instances where men of ability, men\\nof science and training have been crushed by\\npoverty, by a denial of the fruits of their socially\\nhighly constructive labor. ‘\\nMr. Edgar Lucien Larkin, a noted astronomer\\nand writer on scientific subjects, has just died.\\nMr. Larkin was widely known as the director of\\nthe famous Mount Lowe observatory. At the time\\nof his death Larkin was virtually penniless. A\\nlifetime of scientific toil did not enable him to have\\neven enough to pay his last hospital bill.\\nThe paths of capitalist progress are strewn with\\nmany Lucien Larkins. For the maw of workers,\\nfor the great mass of steel workingmen, coal\\nminers, railway hands, garment workers, and other\\nlaborers capitalism holds neither hope nor op\\nportunity. Capitalism lives on crushing the in\\ndividual inceptive of the vast masses of the popula\\ntion who are turned into automatons of the gigan\\ntic profit machinery. What hope, what incentive\\ncan the average employe of the United States Steel\\ncorporatym or the Standard Oil have? The age\\nof the overall-to-the-presidency has gone, if it ever\\nwas with us at all under capitalism.\\nThere is only one system that holds out any\\nhope for the abilities and incentive of the great\\nmasses off the country. This system is one which\\nwill be based on the socialization of the collectively\\nused means of production ami exchange. This sys\\ntem is one which will make it impossible for a few\\nto live on the exploitation of the many. This sys\\ntem is Communism where the working masses will\\nown the agencies and means of production and ex\\nchange and not pay tribute to a parasitic class.\\nTHE DAILY WORKER\\nLaFollette—Bitter Enemy of Immigration\\nBy ALEXANDER TRACHTENBERG.\\nWorkers Party candidate for Congress\\n10th New York District.\\nTHE socialists and liberals who pub\\nlicly proclaimed their opposition\\nto restricted immigration are giving\\nthe LaFollette stand on immigration\\nthe silent treatment. Hoping for\\nvotes for their ‘‘progressive\" presi\\ndential candidate from the foreign\\nborn elements, the supposed advo\\ncates of free Immigration have kept\\nfrom the public the record of senator\\nLaFollette on immigration legislation.\\nWhen senator LaFollette was re\\ncently referred to by a well-known\\nJewish leader as an opponent of free\\nimmigration, the socialist foreign\\nlanguage press \"proved” that their\\nnewly-acquired leader could not be\\nclassed as an energy of immigration,\\nsince on account of illness, he wasn\\'t\\neven present at the senate session\\nwhen the last immigration bill was\\nvoted upon.\\nIt is true that LaFollette was ab\\nsent during the voting on the last im\\nmigration measure last April. But\\nLaFollette has been a senator for\\nabout twenty years, and restrictive\\nimmigration legislation was a great\\npublic issue since 1897, when presi\\ndent Cleveland vetoed an immigration\\nbill containing a literacy test provi\\nsion.\\nWhat are the facts about LaFol\\nlette’s stand on immigration legisla\\ntion during his career in the U. S.\\nsenate? >What was the official record\\nof the “radical” senator from Wiscon\\nsin whenever this important issue\\ncame before the senate? Not only the\\nforeign-born, but progressive workers\\nin general, want to know how senator\\nLaFollette voted every time the re\\nactionary immigration laws came up\\nfor action in the senate.\\nThe following is a review of sena\\ntor LaFollette’s official part in the\\nvicious and oppressive immigration\\nlegislation during the past ten years.\\n1913—LaFollette Votes For the Lit\\neracy Test.\\nOn Feb. 1, 1913, the Burnett-Dilling\\nham Immigration Bill, providing for a\\nliteracy test for all incoming immi\\ngrants passed the senate, and was\\nsent to president Taft for approval\\non the eve of his retirement from\\noffice. Oil account of public agita\\ntion which the measure had awaken\\ned, president Taft was forced to grant\\na public hearing in the White House.\\nRepresentatives of Jewish, Italian,\\nIrish, German, Polish, Hungarian, and\\nother organizations, as well as dele\\ngates from progressive labor unions,\\nattended the hearing, attacked the\\nproposed immigration law, and impor\\ntuned the president to veto the in\\niquitous measure. Impressed by the\\nopposition to the proposed law, and\\nupon advice of the secretary of com\\nmerce and labor Nagel, president\\nTaft vetoed the bill on Feb. 14. On\\nFeb. 18, the senate passed the bill\\nover the veto of the president, by 72\\nto 18 votes, and senator LaFollette\\nvoted to override the veto of the\\npresident, so that the Burnett-Dilling\\nham bill providing for the literacy\\ntest could become a law.\\nWhile the senate, with the aid of\\nLaFollette voted 4 to 1 for the mea\\nsure, the bill failed to become a law\\nbecause the foes of immigration could\\nnot muster the necessary two-thirds\\nmajority in the house of representa\\ntives, to override the veto of the presi\\ndent. In voting for restricted immi\\ngration in 1913, senator LaFollette\\njoined such reactionaries as senator\\nLodge, who declared in the senate\\nMass Revolt in the I. L. G. W. U.\\nBy A. SIMON.\\nThe struggle of the rank and file of\\nthe International Ladies\\' Garment\\nWorkers’ Union against the small\\nband of unscrupulous officials has\\nagain taken on a mass cheffacter.\\nAgain the thousands of workers who\\nhave bled for thp organization, have\\ncome out in open revolt against the,\\nruinous tactics of those in power, who\\nhave converted this once powerful or\\nganization into an instrument for their\\npersonal advancement.\\nOn Saturday, October 11, thousands\\nof cloak and dressmakers marched in\\nmasses to Cooper Union and Stuyve\\nsant Casino. At the call of the needle\\ntrades section, Trades Union Educa\\ntional League, those working men and\\nwomen gathered to give expression\\nto their determined opposition to the\\ntactics of the corrupt machine, which\\nhas again, in gross violation of the\\nmost elementary principles of union\\nism, decided to impose new financial\\nburdens on the workers of the indus\\ntry.\\nA Real Mats Protest.\\nThis mass of workers, urged on by\\ntheir common misery and provocation,\\ncame to voice their protest against\\ntheunwarranted increase in dues im\\nposed upo/i them ugalnst their will,\\nand to begin anew their determined\\nstruggle against the demoralization\\nin the union, which is causing it to\\nabandon positions gained thru years\\nof hard struggle and sacrifice.\\nWhat is the significance of this\\ngroat demonstration, arranged under\\nthe auspices of an organisation out\\nlawed by the officials of that union?\\nFour months ago the convention of\\nthe international met Four months\\nago the leaders had congratulated\\nthemselves upon their successful fight\\nagainst the T. V. E. L. Ten days of\\nthat the immigration bill was “a nec\\nessary defense of American citizen\\nship.”\\n1915—LaFollette Absent With Excuse.\\nThe Burnett-Dillingham immigra\\ntion bill was resurrected in congress\\nin 1914. The senate again passed the\\nbill, but president Wilson vetoed the\\nmeasure on Jan. 28, 1916. As in 1913,\\nthe senate passed the bill over the\\nveto of the president, by a vote of\\nfifty to seven, but the literacy test\\nbill failed to get the necessary two\\nthirds majority in the house by four\\nvotes, and therefore, failed to be\\ncome a law. Senator LaFollette was\\nnot present when the measure came\\nup for a vote in the senate on Jan.\\n2, 1916. LaFollette\\'s friends who\\npraise him for his stand on immigra\\ntion, declare that LaFollette was ab\\nsent. from the session on account of\\ndeath in the family, and must, there\\nfore, be excused for failing to register\\nhis vote for the notorious Burnett-\\nDillingham bill.\\n1916 and 1917 LaFollette Vote*\\nTwice for Literacy Teat Law.\\nThe literacy test laws, having fail\\ned of enactment because of vetoes by\\npresidents Taft and Wilson, came be\\nfore congress again in 1916. The sen\\nate passed a bill by a vote of 64 to\\n7. and senator LaFollette was among\\nthose who voted for the measure to\\nrequire of every prospective immi\\ngrant a literacy test.\\nPresident Wilson vetoed for the sec\\nond time the proposed law on Jan.\\n28, 1917. When it came before the\\nsenate for passage over the presi\\ndent\\'s veto, 19 senators voted to sus\\ntain president Wilson, while 62 voted\\nfor the law. Senator LaFollette was\\none of the 62, and with him were\\nthe other stalwart “progressives” and\\nallies —senators Borah of Idaho: Nor\\nris of Nebraska; and Kenyon of lowa.\\nThanks to senator LaFollette and\\nhis “progressive” colleagues, the lit\\neracy test provision was written into\\nthe immigration law after a struggle\\nof twenty years of foreign-born and\\nprogressive organizations to defeat\\nthis reactionary measure. The Amal\\ngamated Clothing Workers of Ameri\\nca, the International Ladies\\' Garment\\nWorkers’ Union, and other progres\\nsive unions in the American Federa\\ntion of Labor, sent representatives to\\nWashington to fight the measure\\nevery time it came before congress or\\nthe president. Presidents Cleveland,\\nTaft, and Wilson (twice) have vetoed\\nthe measure because of general op\\nposition, but the reactionary leader\\nship of the A. F. of L. aided by La-\\nFollette and his friends in the senate\\nsucceeded in passing the literacy test\\nlaw, which became effective May 1,\\n1917.\\nIn 1916, the socialist party sent\\nCharles Edward Russell to argue be\\nfore president Wilson against the\\nmeasure, and congressman London)\\nvoted against the bill in the house.\\nThe socialist party and former con-,\\ngressman London are now supporting\\nsenator LaFollette, the foe of immi,\\ngration, the man who voted for a mea\\nsure which the socialists then declar\\ned was reactionary and inhuman.\\nFurther Restriction of Immigration.\\nHaving successfully inaugurated\\nthe beginning of legislation for re\\nstricts immigration, Samuel Gompers\\nand his reactionary friends in con\\ngress continued to work for further\\nrestrictive measures. The same day\\nthe literacy test law was passed over\\nthe veto of president Wilson, in 1917,\\nSenator Gardner of Massachusetts in\\ntroduced a bill limiting the number\\nof immigrants to 200,000 in one year.\\nThe introduction of this measure\\nthe convention were spent in unseat\\ning the left wing delegates. Has this\\nfight in any way helped to increase\\nthe confidence of the rank and file in\\nthe leadership?\\nSaturday’s demonstration is the an\\nswer. Why did thousands of workers\\nrespond to the call of the T. U. E. L.\\nBeside fighting the left wing, the con\\nvention of the international adopted\\ntwo other decisions. One calling for\\na general strike in the cloak industry\\nto enforce the demands decided upon\\nby the membership: the other to in\\ncrease the per capita tax five cents\\nper member.\\nOpen Betrayal.\\nImmediately after the convention,\\nthe officials of the International enter\\ned into negotiations with the employ\\ners. These very same leaders who\\nhave shown themselves in full fight\\ning array against the left wing oppo\\nsition in the union were very meek in\\ntheir attitude towards the employers.\\nIn a most cowardly manner, with\\nout consulting the membership, they\\nplaced the fate of fifty thousand\\ncloakmakers in the hands of a com\\nmittee of bankers and Tammany Hall\\npoliticians. On their own responsi\\nbility they accepted an agreement\\nconceding to the employers the most\\nvital demands of the workers.\\nThe stoppage staged in the cloak\\nIndustry drained a half million out\\nof the treasury of the union, but re\\nsulted in no improvement in the con\\nditions of the workers who are today\\nsubjected to the same cutthroat com\\npetition; the same long periods of un\\nemployment, miserable earnings, an<l\\nthe same bitter exploitation. .*\\nGreedy Officialdom.\\nThe cloakmakers had no choice In\\nthe matter. They were simply regard\\ned as shoep who were to be Bhcared\\nmarked the beginning of a campaign\\nfor further restricted immigration,\\nwhich culminated in the infamous im\\nmigrant quota legislation.\\n1921 LaFollette Votes for Vicious\\nQuota Law.\\nAn attempt was first made in 1921\\nby congressman Johnson, to bar all\\nImmigrants for 14 months. The mea\\nsure which was passed however, pro\\nvided for a 3 per cent quota, based up\\non the 1910 censuß. This quota would\\nallow 366,461 immigrants to enter this\\ncountry in one year. The senate com\\nmittee recommended that the quota\\nShould be 6 per cent, but the senate\\nchanged it to 3 per cent. The law\\nwas to be in force for one year—till\\nJune 30, 1922.\\nThe senate passed the first immi\\ngrant quota law on May 3, 1921, by a\\nvote of 78 to 1, and senator LaFollette\\nwas not the one who voted against the\\nmeasure. The sole opponent of re\\nstricted immigration was senator\\nReed of Missouri. Senator LaFollette\\nvoted for the quota law, as did the\\nother “progressive” senators, Norris\\nof Nebraska, Ladd of North Dakota.\\nWalsh of Montana, Johnson of Cali\\nfornia, some of whom are supporting\\nsenator LaFollette inthe present cam\\npaign. ,\\nAs on previous occasions represent\\ntatives of progressive labor unions\\ncame to Washington to plead against\\nthe enactment of the quota legisla-,\\ntion, but the congressmen and sena\\ntors, reactionary and so-called pro\\ngressives alike, voted for the oppres\\nsive immigration regulations. Presi\\ndent Harding approved the 3 per cent\\nquota bill on May 19, 1921.\\n1922 LaFollette Votes to Extend 3\\nPer Cent Law.\\nSince the 3 per cent law was to be\\nin force only one year, hope was en\\ntertained that the law would not be re\\nenacted. A great deal of agitation was\\ncarried on against the law, and the\\ndreadful experiences with the oper\\nations were used to prove the Cruelty\\nof the quota legislation. But the house\\nof representatives voted to extend the\\noperation of the law for another year.\\nThe senate, with senator LaFollette\\npresent, voted without a rollcall to ex\\ntend the law for two years, instead\\nof for one year, as the house provid\\ned, that is, to June 30, 1924, and presi\\ndent Harding approved the extension\\nof the law qp May 11, 1922.\\nSenator LaFollette again showed\\nhis consistent support of reactionary\\nimmigration legislation for which he\\nfirst voted In 1913. The Wisconsin\\nsenator, reputed \"champion of the\\npoor people,” voted for the extension\\n\\'of the 3 per cent quota law for two\\nyears, notwithstanding the tremen\\ndous opposition of progressive labor\\norganizations to this reactionary and\\ncruel measure.\\n1924 LaFollette Absent, But His\\nFriends Are There.\\nAs tho the 3 per cent quota law was\\nnot reactionary enough, the anti-im\\nmigration lobby in congress worked\\nto make the law still more severe, and\\nthe “progressives” in congress help\\ned to reduce still further the actual\\nquota of immigrants to “free\" Ameri\\nca. The immigration bitter-enders\\nproposed that the quota be cut in ■\\nhalf—that is, instead of allowing\\nabout 360,000 immigrants a year, only\\n160,000 should be permitted to land\\nhere. The law was changed to pro\\nvide for 2 per cent quota based on the\\n1890 census. It was particulrly direct\\ned against the Jewish, Italian and\\nSlavic immigrants.\\nSenator LaFollette was not pres\\nent when the vote was taken in the\\nsenate on April 18, 1924, on the 2 per\\nfor the ease and comfort of the offi\\ncials and their supporters.\\nIt was in this spirit that the one\\nconstructive decision of the conven\\ntion was carried thru. Not so with\\nthe increase In dues. The five cents\\nincrease decided upon by the conven\\ntion did not suffice. The herd of ma\\nchine hangers-op must have their toll.\\nThe “loyal” supporters must be re\\nwarded with jobs and fat salaries.\\nHence the cloak and dress makers\\nmust pay increased dues.\\nThe recommendation for an increase\\nof fifteen cents, coming after \\'a colos\\nsal defeat in the cloak industry, out\\nrages even the most backward work\\ners.
